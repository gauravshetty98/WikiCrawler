Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and telephone numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list (contact scraping).
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Web scraping is used for contact scraping, and as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup and, web data integration.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Newer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from web servers.  For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the web server.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in  DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"The history of the web scraping dates back nearly to the time when the Internet was born.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions. Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX grep command or regular expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python).
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using socket programming.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content and translates it into a relational form, is called a wrapper. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[2] Moreover, some semi-structured data query languages, such as XQuery and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.[3]
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the Internet Explorer or the Mozilla browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as Xpath can be used to parse the resulting DOM tree.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of ""bots"" for specific verticals with no ""man in the loop"" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the Long Tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"The pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[4] are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"There are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[5]
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"There are many software tools available that can be used to customize web-scraping solutions. This software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web-scraping code, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an API directly.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of use of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[6]
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"In the United States, website owners can use three major legal claims to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (""CFAA""), and (3) trespass to chattel.[7] However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service that duplication of facts is allowable.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of ""scrapers"" or ""robots"" may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,[8][9] which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[10]
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"One of the first major tests of screen scraping involved American Airlines (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[11] AA successfully obtained an injunction from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[12]
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Southwest Airlines has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of ""Computer Fraud and Abuse"" and has led to ""Damage and Loss"" and ""Unauthorized Access"" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes ""Interference with Business Relations"", ""Trespass"", and ""Harmful Access by Computer"". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as ""Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment"", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law in this case should be US Copyright law, and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company Yahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[13]
In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in Craigslist v. 3Taps. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled, and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[14]
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In a 2010 ruling in the Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc. In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced.[15] In a 2014 case, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[16] e-commerce site QVC objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly ""excessively crawled"" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[17] QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"In the plaintiff's web site during the period of this trial the terms of use link is displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the browse wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse wrap contracting practices.[18]
"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"In Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.[19][20] In Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc., a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater.

"
Web scraping - Wikipedia,"In a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland's High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law. In the case of Ryanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH, Ireland's High Court ruled Ryanair's ""click-wrap"" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice Michael Hanna ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.

Computer network programming - Wikipedia,"Computer network programming involves writing computer programs that enable processes to communicate with each other across a computer network.[1]
"
Computer network programming - Wikipedia,"Very generally, most of communications can be divided into connection-oriented, and connectionless. Whether a communication is a connection-oriented, or connectionless, is defined by the communication protocol, and not by application programming interface (API). Examples of the connection-oriented protocols include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX), and examples of connectionless protocols include User Datagram Protocol (UDP), ""raw IP"", and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX).
"
Computer network programming - Wikipedia,"For connection-oriented communications, communication parties usually have different roles. One party is usually waiting for incoming connections; this party is usually referred to as ""server"". Another party is the one which initiates connection; this party is usually referred to as ""client"".
"
Computer network programming - Wikipedia,"For connectionless communications, one party (""server"") is usually waiting for an incoming packet, and another party (""client"") is usually understood as the one which sends an unsolicited packet to ""server"".
"
Computer network programming - Wikipedia,"Network programming traditionally covers different layers of OSI/ISO model (most of application-level programming belongs to L4 and up). The table below contains some examples of popular protocols belonging to different OSI/ISO layers, and popular APIs for them.
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. [1]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered.  It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"Historically, IP was the connectionless datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974, which was complemented by a connection-oriented service that became the basis for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as TCP/IP.
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The first major version of IP, Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since c. 2006.[2]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing host interfaces, encapsulating data into datagrams (including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing datagrams from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.[3] For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"Each datagram has two components: a header and a payload.  The IP header includes source IP address, destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram.  The payload is the data that is transported.  This method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called encapsulation.
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"IP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces.  The address space is divided into subnetworks, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as routers, whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries.  Routers communicate with one another via specially designed routing protocols, either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocols, as needed for the topology of the network.[4]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"In May 1974, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published a paper entitled ""A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication"".[5] The paper's authors, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes. A central control component of this model was the ""Transmission Control Program"" that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol at the transport layer and the Internet Protocol at the internet layer. The model became known as the Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Model and Internet protocol suite, and informally as TCP/IP.
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"IP versions 1 to 3 were experimental versions, designed between 1973 and 1978.[6] The following Internet Experiment Note (IEN) documents describe version 3 of the Internet Protocol, prior to the modern version of IPv4:
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The dominant internetworking protocol in the Internet Layer in use is IPv4; the number 4 identifies the protocol version, carried in every IP datagram. IPv4 is described in RFC 791 (1981).
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"Version number 5 was used by the Internet Stream Protocol, an experimental streaming protocol that was not adopted.[6]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The successor to IPv4 is IPv6. IPv6 was a result of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed, such as TP/IX (RFC 1475), PIP (RFC 1621) and TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses, RFC 1347). Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses 32 bits for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 billion (4.3×109) addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses providing ca. 3.4×1038 addresses. Although adoption of IPv6 has been slow, as of June 2008[update], all United States government systems have demonstrated basic infrastructure support for IPv6.[7]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The assignment of the new protocol as IPv6 was uncertain until due diligence assured that IPv6 had not been used previously.[8] Other Internet Layer protocols have been assigned version numbers,[9] such as 7 (IP/TX), 8 and 9 (historic). Notably, on April 1, 1994, the IETF published an April Fools' Day joke about IPv9.[10] IPv9 was also used in an alternate proposed address space expansion called TUBA.[11]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The design of the Internet protocol suite adheres to the end-to-end principle, a concept adapted from the CYCLADES project. Under the end-to-end principle, the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and is dynamic in terms of the availability of links and nodes. No central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network. For the benefit of reducing network complexity, the intelligence in the network is purposely located in the end nodes.[12]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"As a consequence of this design, the Internet Protocol only provides best-effort delivery and its service is characterized as unreliable. In network architectural parlance, it is a connectionless protocol, in contrast to connection-oriented communication. Various fault conditions may occur, such as data corruption, packet loss and duplication. Because routing is dynamic, meaning every packet is treated independently, and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets, different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths, resulting in out-of-order delivery to the receiver.
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"All fault conditions in the network must be detected and compensated by the participating end nodes. The upper layer protocols of the Internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues. For example, a host may buffer network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application.
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"IPv4 provides safeguards to ensure that the header of an IP packet is error-free. A routing node discards packets that fail a header checksum test. Although the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) provides notification of errors, a routing node is not required to notify either end node of errors. IPv6, by contrast, operates without header checksums, since current link layer technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection.[13][14]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The dynamic nature of the Internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of, or suitable for, performing the data transmission requested. One of the technical constraints is the size of data packets possible on a given link. Facilities exist to examine the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the local link and Path MTU Discovery can be used for the entire intended path to the destination.[15]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The IPv4 internetworking layer automatically fragments a datagram into smaller units for transmission when the link MTU is exceeded. IP provides re-ordering of fragments received out of order.[16] An IPv6 network does not perform fragmentation in network elements, but requires end hosts and higher-layer protocols to avoid exceeding the path MTU.[17]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an example of a protocol that adjusts its segment size to be smaller than the MTU. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and ICMP disregard MTU size, thereby forcing IP to fragment oversized datagrams.[18]
"
Internet Protocol - Wikipedia,"During the design phase of the ARPANET and the early Internet, the security aspects and needs of a public, international network could not be adequately anticipated.  Consequently, many Internet protocols exhibited vulnerabilities highlighted by network attacks and later security assessments.  In 2008, a thorough security assessment and proposed mitigation of problems was published.[19] The IETF has been pursuing further studies.[20]

Songwriter - Wikipedia,"A songwriter is a musician who professionally composes musical compositions and writes lyrics for songs. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre and film scoring, but is also associated  writing and composing the original musical composition or musical bed. A songwriter who mainly writes the lyrics for a song is referred to as a lyricist. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that song writing is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people.[1] For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. Pop songs may be composed by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by music publishers.[1] Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.[1]

Songwriter - Wikipedia,"The old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supplemented by university degrees and college diplomas and ""rock schools"".[1] Knowledge of modern music technology (sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing), songwriting elements and business skills are now often requirements for a songwriter. Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules.[1] Since songwriting and publishing royalties can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a hit record; legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. This is governed by international copyright law.[1]

Songwriter - Wikipedia,"Songwriters can be employed to write either the lyrics or the music directly for or alongside a performing artist, or they present songs to A&R, publishers, agents and managers for consideration. Song pitching can be done on a songwriter's behalf by their publisher or independently using tip sheets like RowFax, the MusicRow publication and SongQuarters.[1] Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity.[2] Staff writers do not necessarily get printed credit for their contributions to the song.

In the form of contract agreement as a songwriter also a publisher can appoint a duty of publication of copyrighted works for' 'staffs. Being a staff writer effectively means that, during the term of the songwriter's contract with the publisher, all their songs are automatically published by that company and cannot be published elsewhere.[1]
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"In the Nashville country music scene, there is a strong staff writer culture where contracted writers work normal ""9-to-5"" hours at the publishing office and are paid a regular salary, says staff writer Gary Growden. This salary is in effect the writer's ""draw"", an advance on future earnings, which is paid on a monthly basis and enables them to live within a fixed budget.[3] The publisher owns the copyright of songs written during the term of the agreement for a designated period, after which the songwriter can reclaim the copyright.[3] In an interview with HitQuarters, songwriter Dave Berg extolled the benefits of the set-up: ""I was able to concentrate on writing the whole time and have always had enough money to live on.""[4]
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"Unlike contracted writers, some staff writers operate as employees for their respective publishers. Under the terms of these 
work for hire agreements, the compositions created are fully owned by the publisher. Because the recapture provision of the United States Copyright Act of 1976 does not apply to ""works made for hire,"" the rights to a song created under an employment contract cannot be ""recaptured"" by the writer after 35 years. In Nashville, young writers are often strongly encouraged to avoid these types of contracts.
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"Staff writers are common across the whole industry, but without the more office-like working arrangements favored in Nashville. All the major publishers employ writers under contract.[4] Obtaining a staff writer contract with a publisher can be a first step for any professional songwriting career, with some writers with a desire for greater independence outgrowing this set-up once they achieve a degree of success.[4] Songwriter Allan Eshuijs described his staff writer contract at Universal Music Publishing as a starter deal. His success under the arrangement eventually allowed him to found his own publishing company, so that he could ""keep as much [publishing income] as possible and say how it's going to be done.""[5]
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"Songwriters are also often skilled musicians. In part, this is because the process of ""working out"" a song or arrangement requires a songwriter to play an instrument, typically the guitar or the piano, to hear how the chord progression sounds and to hear how well a given set of chords supports a melody. In addition to selling their songs and musical concepts for other artists to sing, some songwriter-musicians create songs to perform themselves. Songwriters need to create a number of elements for a song, including an introduction, various verses and a chorus. At minimum, a songwriter must prepare a lead sheet for a song, which consists of one or more pieces of sheet music with the melody notes and chord progression indicated on it.
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"The songwriter may expand upon the melody and chord progression by adding an instrumental melody (which may occur before or after the vocal melody, or alongside the vocal melody) and creating a more complex song structure (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental solo section, verse, etc.).

Songwriter - Wikipedia,"With recent technological improvements, a songwriter can now create commercially viable music almost entirely on their laptop. This technological advancement has made the producer/songwriter role a much more popular occurrence. Perhaps because the role of producer is not generally understood by the public, the average listener does not know when an artist also takes on the role of producer.

Songwriter - Wikipedia,"Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys is one of the earliest and most widely known examples of a songwriter turned music producer. Within two years of the band's commercial breakthrough, Wilson had taken over from his father Murry, and he was the sole producer of all their recordings between 1963 and 1967.

Songwriter - Wikipedia,"A beatmaker is a songwriter who creates and composes music or beats for a song, often laying the groundwork or 'musical bed'. Then a composer who specializes in melody will create the top-line for the track. Tools typically used are keyboards, drum machines, softsynths and digital audio workstations. Beat makers or composers aren't necessarily record producers by definition or acting role since they generally do not work directly with an artist in a recording studio that oversees the production and recording of the final product. However, record producers can be involved in co-writing songs as the composer wearing two hats as the producer and songwriter as they may write and compose the original music such as the beat and then oversee the production that takes control of the recording sessions with the artist and engineer all the way down to the mix stage. They are referred to as Record Producer / Songwriters as they generally receive songwriting and production credits for both roles. This is especially true for R&B, hip-hop producers in urban hip hop production, when composing the original music as the co-writer is integrated into their traditional role as a Record Producer, such as Rodney Jerkins, Dr. Dre, Timbaland or Pharrell Williams, as opposed to a rock producer that may rarely contribute as a co-writer of a song.

Songwriter - Wikipedia,"Many singers also write songs for themselves, and as such, they are usually referred to as singer-songwriters.
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"Songs written by more than one person is co-written, written jointly or written in collaboration with another author.[6] Co-writers may use the “stream of consciousness” approach, referring to having ideas flow rather than being discussed. The first step in co-writing is to establish the division of the contribution between co-writers. In copyright law, there is no distinction of importance between the lyrics of the song or the melody of the song, therefore each writer is given equal ownership over the song, unless another agreement is arranged.[7] ""Phantom"" songwriters provide small contributions to songs. The songwriter suggests a line for a verse or a session musician who informally proposes a chord progression for a coda. “Phantom” songwriters are usually not given credit.
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"A top-line writer or top-liner is a songwriter who writes a song over a pre-made beat. Top-lining differs from songwriting in that the writer is not creating a song from scratch, but rather creating lyrics and melodies over an existing music genre, tonality, harmony, rhythm, and form of a song.[8]
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"In modern commercial writing, it is a common practice for the musical track to be produced first without any vocal melody or lyrics. This is partially due to the rise of portable music production equipment and digital audio workstations that are designed for the swift arrangement of electronic music, such as Cubase [9] and Ableton Live.[10]
"
Songwriter - Wikipedia,"The top-liner usually is also a singer, and will sing over the track as the demo singer. If the song is for a particular artist, the top-liner may sing the demo in that artist's style. Top-liners often work in groups to co-write. Sometimes producers send out tracks to more than one top-line writer so that the producer or singer could choose the best option. Since the track is the same, melodies by different writers can sometimes be very similar. Occasionally, the producer might choose a few lines of melodic or lyrical ideas from one top-liner without properly crediting or paying them. These situations sometimes result in legal battles over ownership of the melodies or lyrics.[11]

United States - Wikipedia,"Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Disputes over taxation and political representation with Great Britain led to the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which established independence. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began vigorously expanding across North America, gradually acquiring new territories, oftentimes killing and displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the American Civil War led to its abolition. The Spanish–American War and World War I established the U.S. as a world power, a status confirmed by the outcome of World War II. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in various proxy wars but avoided direct military conflict. They also competed in the Space Race, culminating in the 1969 spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 ended the Cold War and left the United States as the world's sole superpower, with immense power in global geopolitics.

The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, such as Saint Augustine (often considered the nation's oldest city)[47] and Santa Fe. The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River, notably New Orleans.[48] Successful English settlement of the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and with the Pilgrims colony at Plymouth in 1620.[49] Many settlers were dissenting Christians who came seeking religious freedom.[50] The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses, was founded in 1619. Documents such as the Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[51][52]

United States - Wikipedia,"In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and European settlers. In many cases, however, the natives and settlers came to depend on one another. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts; natives for guns, tools and other European goods.[53] Natives taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. European missionaries and others felt it was important to ""civilize"" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles.[54][55] However, with the increased European  colonization of North America, the Native Americans were displaced and often killed.[56] The native population of America declined after European arrival for various reasons,[57][58][59] primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.[60][61]

Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery. Two other amendments were also ratified, ensuring citizenship for blacks and, at least in theory, voting rights for them as well.

During the war, the United States was one of the ""Four Powers""[122] who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China.[123][124] Although the nation lost around 400,000 military personnel,[125] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[126]

Eating roadkill was already legal – as it is in most places – but required prior notification to the county game warden.

"Mendocino County, California - Wikipedia","Mendocino County was one of the original counties of California, created in 1850 at the time of statehood. Due to an initially minor settler American population, it did not have a separate government until 1859 and was under the administration of Sonoma County prior to that.[8] Some of the county's land was given to Sonoma County between 1850 and 1860.[9]

"Mendocino County, California - Wikipedia","In the 19th century, despite the establishment of the Mendocino Indian Reservation and Nome Cult Farm in 1856, the county witnessed many of the most serious atrocities in the extermination of the Californian Native American tribes who originally lived in the area, like the Yuki, the Pomo, the Cahto, and the Wintun. The systematic occupation of their lands, the reduction of many of their members into slavery and the raids against their settlements led to the Mendocino War in 1859, where hundreds of Indians were killed.  Establishment of the Round Valley Indian Reservation on March 30, 1870, did not prevent the segregation that continued well into the 20th century. Other tribes from the Sierra Nevada mountains were also relocated to the Round Valley Indian Reservation during the ""California Trail Of Tears"", where the Natives were forced to march in bad conditions to their new home in Round Valley.[11] Many of these tribes thrown together were not on good terms with the other tribes they were forced to live with on the reservation, resulting in tensions still evident today.

Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia's goal is to be a free content encyclopedia, with free content defined as content that does not bear copyright restrictions on the right to redistribute, study, modify and improve, or otherwise use works for any purpose in any medium, even commercially. Any content not satisfying these criteria is said to be non-free. This includes all content (including images) that is fully copyrighted, or which is made available subject to restrictions such as ""non-commercial use only"" or ""for use on Wikipedia only"". (Many images that are generally available free of charge may thus still be ""non-free"" for Wikipedia's purposes.)  The Foundation uses the definition of ""free"" as described here.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"The licensing policy of the Wikimedia Foundation expects all content hosted on Wikimedia projects to be free content; however, there are exceptions. The policy allows projects (with the exception of Wikimedia Commons) to adopt an exemption doctrine policy allowing the use of non-free content. Their use should be minimal and confined (with limited exceptions) to illustrating historically significant events, to include identifying protected works such as logos, or to complement (within narrow limits) articles about copyrighted contemporary works. Non-free content should not be used when a freely licensed file that serves the same purpose can reasonably be expected to be uploaded, as is the case for almost all portraits of living people. Non-free content should be replaced by free content should such emerge.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"The Non-free content criteria policy currently serves as the exemption doctrine policy of the English Wikipedia, while this document serves to provide guidance associated with this policy. Non-free content can be used on Wikipedia in certain cases (for example, in some situations where acquiring a freely licensed image for a particular subject is not possible), but only within the United States legal doctrine of fair use, and in accordance with Wikipedia's own non-free content criteria as set out below. The use of non-free content on Wikipedia is therefore subject to purposely stricter standards than those laid down in U.S. copyright law.

Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"There is no automatic entitlement to use non-free content in an article or elsewhere on Wikipedia.

Other non-free content—including all copyrighted images, audio and video clips, and other media files that lack a free content license—may be used on the English Wikipedia only where all 10 of the following criteria are met.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Deletion criteria for non-free content are specified in Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion § Files.

Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"The implementation of the non-free content criteria is done by having two specific elements on the non-free media's description page:
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Both the license and the rationale need to be included on the non-free media description page. The standard upload tool for Wikipedia will ask you enough questions during the process to fill in both the license and rationale for you, thus simplifying the process. If they are added manually, with or without the help of a template, it is recommended to put the rationale and license under separate sections ""Rationale"" and ""Licensing"" respectively.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Failure to include a licensing template, or a rationale that clearly identifies each article the media file is used in, will lead to the media file being deleted within 7 days after being tagged with warning messages.

Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"
Non-free content cannot be used in cases where a free content equivalent, with an acceptable quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose, is available or could be created. As a quick test, before adding non-free content, ask yourself: "
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"If the answer to either is yes, the non-free content probably does not meet this criterion.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Another consideration for ""no free equivalent"" are ""freer"" versions of non-free media, typically which include derivative works. For example, a photograph of a copyrighted 3D work of art will also carry the copyright of the photographer in addition to the copyright of the artist that created the work. We would use a photograph where the photographer has licensed their photograph under a free license, retaining the copyright of the derivative work, instead of a photograph that has non-free licenses for both the photograph and work of art.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"For a vector image (i.e. SVG) of a non-free logo or other design, US law is not clear as to whether the vectorisation of the logo has its own copyright which exists in addition to any copyright on the actual logo. To avoid this uncertainty, editors who upload vector images of non-free logos should use a vector image that was produced by the copyright holder of the logo and should not use a vector image from a site such as seeklogo.com or Brands of the World where the vectorisation of a logo may have been done without authorization from the logo's copyright holder. If an editor bases a vectorisation they did by themself from a free image, they should indicate the source image so that freeness can be confirmed, and release their contribution (the labour of converting to vectors) under a free license to help with the aforementioned ambiguity.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Very often, such as for most non-free content emanating from the news and entertainment industries, meeting this criterion is not in question.  In rare cases however, non-free content may have been originally ""leaked"" and never subsequently published with the copyright holder's permission—such content must not be included in Wikipedia.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Usually, an accompanying copyright notice is considered sufficient evidence that a publication in the media has been made with appropriate permission.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"If, in this regard, an item of non-free content is questioned or is likely to be questioned, then details of an instance of prior publication with permission must be determined and recorded at the non-free media's description page.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Two of the most common circumstances in which an item of non-free content can meet the contextual significance criterion are:
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"In all cases, meeting the criterion depends on the significance of the understanding afforded by the non-free content, which can be determined according to the principles of due weight and balance.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"To identify a subject of discussion, depiction of a prominent aspect of the subject generally suffices, thus only a single item of non-free content meets the criterion. For example, to allow identification of music albums, books, etc., only an image of the front cover art of the object is normally used; for identification of specific coins and currency, images of the front and back are normally used.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"While there is no specific requirement in the non-free content policy to identify the source from which a non-free file was obtained, editors are strongly encouraged to make note of the source on the media's description page; many of the non-free rationale templates already include a field for this information. This can aid in the cases of disputed media files, or evaluating the non-free or free nature of the image. Lacking a source is not grounds for media removal, but if the nature of the media file is disputed, the lack of a source may prevent the file from being retained. Non-free media must be from a published source; the unpublished non-free media is forbidden. Identification of the source will aid in validating the previous publication of the material.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"The source information should be sufficiently complete to allow any editor to validate that material. While completeness is not required, editors are encouraged to provide as much source information as they can. Some ways to source media files include:
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Articles are structured and worded to minimize the total number of items of non-free content that are included within the encyclopedia, where it is reasonable to do so.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"For example, an excerpt of a significant artistic work is usually included only in the article about the work, which is then referenced in the articles about its performer and its publisher.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"A single item of non-free content that conveys multiple points of significant understanding within a topic is preferred to multiple non-free items which each convey fewer such points. This is independent of whether the topic is covered by a single article, or is split across several.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"For example, an article about an ensemble may warrant the inclusion of a non-free image identifying the ensemble. This is preferable to including separate non-free images for each member of the ensemble, even if the article has been split with each member having their own sub-section of the article.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"There is no firm guideline on allowable resolutions for non-free content; images should be rescaled as small as possible to still be useful as identified by their rationale, and no larger. This metric is very qualitative, and thus difficult to enforce. Some legal proceedings have discussed the issue, but are inconclusive here.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"At the low pixel count end of the range, most common pictorial needs can be met with an image containing no more than about 100,000 pixels (0.1 megapixels), obtained by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel dimensions of an image. This allows, for example, images with a 4:3 aspect ratio to be shown at 320 × 240 pixels (common for screenshots from TV, films, and videogames), while allowing common cover art to be shown at 250 × 400 pixels. To scale an image down to a specific number of pixels, use this formula:
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"or use this tool to compute it for you.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"At the extreme high end of the range, non-free images where one dimension exceeds 1,000 pixels, or where the pixel count approaches 1 megapixel, will very likely require a close review to verify that the image needs that level of resolution. Editors should ensure that the image rationale fully explains the need for such a level of detail. You also may wish to add the {{non-free no reduce}} template to the image rationale page to indicate that your image resolution purposely exceeds the 0.1 megapixels guideline, though this still requires you to include a valid rationale that explains this reasoning; large images using this template without a rationale to explain the large size may nonetheless be reduced.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"An original, high resolution image (that can be reasonably scaled down to maintain overall artistic and critical details) may lose some text detail. In such cases, that text should be duplicated on the image description page.  Care should be given to the recreation of copyrighted text: for example, while it is appropriate for credits from a movie poster as factual data, such duplication would not be appropriate for an original poem embedded within an image.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"If a small area of a large image needs high resolution to see details that are discussed in the article text, it may be better to crop the section to show the critical portion at a higher resolution, than to try to reduce the full image. If cropping is performed, editors should indicate the original source of the image and what modifications were made.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"If you believe an image is oversized, either re-upload a new version at the same file location, or tag the image file page with a {{Non-free reduce}} template, which will place it in a maintenance category to be reduced by volunteers or a bot like DatBot.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Note that these guidelines apply to the resolution as stored on the image file page; the reuse of these images in mainspace should follow the Manual of Style for image use, such as deferring to default thumbnail size to allow the end-user control of the image display.

Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Material that is not free is permitted only if it meets the restrictions of this policy. This has been explicitly declared since May 2005.[4] The stated mission of the Wikimedia Foundation, which supports Wikipedia servers and software, is ""to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally."" These concerns are embodied in the above requirements that all non-free content must meet, and our policy of deleting non-compliant content. Being generous to the world sometimes means being hard on ourselves. Please understand that these rules are not arbitrary; they are central to our mission.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia distributes content throughout the world with no restrictions on how people use it. Legally, we could use any copyrighted material for ourselves that is either licensed to us by the owner, or that fits the definition of ""fair use"" under US copyright law. However, we favor content that everyone can use, not just Wikipedia. We want them to be free to use, redistribute, or modify the content, for any purpose, without significant legal restrictions, particularly those of copyright.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"To honor its mission, Wikipedia accepts incoming copyright licenses only if they meet Wikipedia's definition of ""free"" use. This is a higher standard than we would need just for our own use.  But our ability to use a work does not guarantee that others may use it. We reject licenses that limit use exclusively to Wikipedia or for non-commercial purposes. Commercial use is a complex issue that goes well beyond a company's for-profit status, another reason to be careful. In fact, we reject any licenses with significant limitations. That is not free enough.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Similarly, Wikipedia imposes higher fair-use standards on itself than U.S. copyright law. There are some works, such as important photographs, significant modern artworks, that we cannot realistically expect to be released under a free content license, but that are hard to discuss in an educational context without including examples from the media itself. In other cases such as cover art/product packaging, a non-free work is needed to discuss a related subject. This policy allows such material to be used if it meets U.S. legal tests for fair use, but we impose additional limitations. Just because something is ""fair use"" on a Wikipedia article in the US does not mean it is fair use in another context. A downstream user's commercial use of content in a commercial setting may be illegal even if our noncommercial use is legal. Use in another country with different fair use and fair dealing laws may be illegal as well. That would fail our mission. We therefore  limit the media content we offer, to make sure what we do offer has the widest possible legal distribution.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"We do not want downstream re-users to rely solely on our assurances. They are liable for their own actions, no matter what we tell them.  We therefore show them and let them make their own decision. To that end we require a copyright tag describing the nature of a copyrighted work, sourcing material saying exactly where any non-free content comes from, and a detailed non-free media rationale for every use of copyrighted content in every article, justifying why use in that article is permitted.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"A further goal of minimizing licensed and fair-use material is to encourage creation of original new content, rather than relying on borrowed content that comes with restrictions.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Under United States copyright law, creative works published in the United States prior to 1925 are in the public domain. Some creative works published in the United States between 1925 and 1963 are still copyrighted.  It is illegal (among other things) to reproduce or make derivative works of copyrighted works without legal justification.[5] Unless a thorough search is conducted to determine that a copyright has expired or not been renewed, it should be regarded as copyrighted.[6]
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Certain works have no copyright at all.  Most material  published in the United States before 1925, work published before 1978 without a copyright notice, with an expired copyright term, or produced by the  U.S. federal government is public domain, i.e., has no copyright. Some such as photos and scans of 2-dimensional objects and other ""slavish reproductions"", short text phrases, typographic logos, and product designs, do not have a sufficient degree of creativity apart from their functional aspects to have a copyright.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Copyright law only governs creative expressions that are ""fixed in a tangible medium of expression,"" not the ideas or information behind the works.  It is legal to reformulate ideas based on written texts, or create images or recordings inspired by others, as long as there is no copying (see plagiarism for how much reformulation is necessary).
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"If material does have a copyright, it may only be copied or distributed under a license (permission) from the copyright holder, or under the doctrine of  fair use. If there is a valid license, the user must stay within the scope of the license (which may include limitations on amount of use, geographic or business territory, time period, nature of use, etc.). Fair use, by contrast, is a limited right to use copyrighted works without permission, highly dependent on the specific circumstances of the work and the use in question. It is a doctrine incorporated as a clause in United States copyright code, arising out of a concern that strict application of copyright law would limit criticism, commentary, scholarship, and other important free speech rights. A comparable concept of fair dealing exists in some other countries, where standards may vary.

Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Uploading an image, audio or video file, or text quotation into Wikipedia, and adding that file to a project page, both raise copyright concerns.  Editors who do either must make sure their contributions are legal. If there is any doubt as to legality, ask others for help, try to find a free equivalent, or use your own words to make the same point. Also, consider asking the copyright holder to release the work under an appropriate Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC BY-SA) or a CC BY-SA-compatible license (dual-licensing under a GFDL license is also possible). See Wikipedia:Boilerplate request for permission for a sample form letter.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"If a work has no copyright or is licensed to Wikipedia under an acceptable ""free"" license, it is a free work and may be used on Wikipedia without copyright concerns. See public domain, copyright, and Cornell University's guide to copyright terms for discussion of works that are not covered by copyright. Also see free license regarding free licenses and Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Free licenses for a list of copyright tags for these works. Restricted licenses to these works offer some legal rights, but Wikipedia ignores them because they are not free enough for its purposes. Instead, works covered by inadequate licenses are treated the same on Wikipedia as works with no licenses at all.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"If a work is not free, Wikipedia requires that it comply with Wikipedia's non-free use policy. As explained above, this policy is more restrictive than US law requires. Logically, material that satisfies the policy should also satisfy legal requirements as well. However, to be more certain of avoiding legal liability, and to understand the meaning of Wikipedia policy, editors should consider the legal rules as well.  See fair use for further information, and the Stanford University summary of relevant cases, on the subject of fair use.
"
Wikipedia:Non-free content - Wikipedia,"Non-free material is used only if, in addition to other restrictions, we firmly believe that the use would be deemed fair use if we were taken to court.

Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission - Wikipedia,"To use copyrighted material on Wikipedia, it is not enough that we have permission to use it on Wikipedia alone. That's because Wikipedia itself states all its material may be used by anyone, for any purpose. So we have to be sure all material is in fact licensed for that purpose, whoever provided it.
"
Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission - Wikipedia,"To do this, we must often email or contact the copyright holders and ask them to irrevocably release the source material under one or more suitably-free and compatible copyright licenses, so that the content may be used at Wikipedia.

Help:Category - Wikipedia,"The most effective way of finding entries of a category is using the ""What links here"" tool on the category's main article.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"An easy way to find relevant articles for a new category or missing entries in an existing one is by finding the most relevant list and checking its entries. Sometimes categories are about things that are intersections of other categories for which the PetScan tool can be used.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"More relevant articles may also be found linked in a category's main article and the articles already featured in the category − especially in their ""See also"" sections (if existent) and the automatically suggested ""RELATED ARTICLES"" below them.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Furthermore, a category's superordinate categories often feature articles that should be subcategorized to the category.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Other ways to find relevant articles include searching Wikipedia for the category's topic and searching the Web for the topic in quotes "" (with synonyms also in quotes and appended after an OR) and appending the word wiki or Wikipedia or site:Wikipedia.org to them.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Templates are categorized the same way as articles, except that [[Category: Some-topic templates]] should be placed on the template's documentation page (or inside <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, if there is no documentation page), this is necessary to avoid categorizing pages by template inclusion (see below).
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside <includeonly></includeonly> tags on the template (e.g. <includeonly>[[Category:category name]]</includeonly>).  When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page.  This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page.  When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved.  When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list. Performing a  null edit to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"To add the template itself to the category page as well, omit the ""includeonly"" tags. To add the template to a category without categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, or add it to the template documentation page between <includeonly></includeonly> (the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch it).

Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"A diff (from the word ""difference"") is a web page displaying the difference between one version and another of a Wikipedia page. A particular version of a page is called a ""revision""; each revision has a unique date and time of creation which can be seen in the page history. Clicking a ""diff"" link in a page's history will display the diff of two successive revisions.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"Links to diffs are found on various special pages other than page histories, including the User contributions page which every user has, Recent changes, Related changes, and watchlists.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"Using the history of a page, it is possible to generate a diff between any two versions – select the left radio button for the older version, the right radio button for the newer version, and click Compare selected revisions.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"While editing a page, the Show changes button displays the changes you are about to make. The diff is also shown during an edit conflict.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"This example shows the top of the diff page (some of the links are dummies). The older version is shown on the left, the newer version on the right.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"Unchanged text is dark grey on light grey (only parts before and after changed text are shown). Paragraphs which have changed are black on white, with an orange border on the old version side and a blue border on the new version side. Inserted and removed text is highlighted with the border color and bolded. Where whole paragraphs have been removed or inserted, no highlighting or bolding is applied and the other side is blank.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"The links ""Revision as of date"" link to each version. If the newer version is the latest one, the link will be to the usual page and the wording will be ""Current revision (date)"" instead. 
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"The ""(edit)"" link will take you to the page for editing that version. You may be warned that you are editing an out-of-date revision; if you ignore this and continue, you will revert all the edits made since after that revision. 
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"The ""(undo)"" link on the newer revision's side will revert that specific edit. When you click the link you can check the diff page of the edit you are going to make, and the edit summary will be automatically filled in with the phrase of MediaWiki:undo-summary (Undid revision $1 by $2 (talk)). This summary can be edited before you submit your edit. When you are undoing several edits at once, the auto-summary may not work. Though the link exists on all diff pages, it does not function when the revisions conflict. Often versions older than the current one cannot be undone in this way. If it does not work, you will be told that the edit could not be undone and end up in the regular editing page of the current version.

Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"If you need to create a link to a specific diff (for use on a talk page or noticeboard, for example), it is best to use the [[Special:Diff/oldid]] method or {{Diff}}, which make links work across protocols (http:// vs. https://) and on our mobile site. Alternatively, locate the diff from the page history, go to the diff page, and copy the URL from your browser's address bar. You can paste this URL (the whole of it, including http://) into the text of the page where you want the link to appear, putting single square brackets [...] around it.

Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"When moving or copying a piece of text within a page or from another page, and also making other edits in the same revision, the diff can still compare moved paragraphs, even if weave-moved over 20 paragraphs away. Prior to August 2018, a diff could be kept clearer (simpler), by first using a separate edit to insert blank lines plus move the text paragraphs, then after saving, in further revisions, add or change text within the moved paragraphs. Only if paragraphs are both split and reworded in the same revision, then the specific new words cannot be individually highlighted as different from the prior revision. A split paragraph will typically highlight the 2nd part(s) as if new text on the page. The weave-diff can compare paragraphs word-for-word if moved, but not if split.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"A diff shows differences per line, so it synchronizes between revisions by matching the newlines and unchanged lines. Some editors find that having additional line breaks to break up the text improves the diff function. Otherwise, those large, massive globs of text can be difficult to compare after a split. Keep sentences limited in length, such as with four prepositions, and seek shorter paragraphs. Long wp:reftag footnotes (<ref>...</ref>) may be split with internal newlines as well.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"If you're trying to find the point in a page's history where a particular change was made, and searching the edit summaries does not help, try taking the diff between points roughly 1/3 and 2/3 of the way through the history. From this diff, you can work out in which of the three parts of the history the change occurred. Repeat this process, narrowing the ""search space"" by a factor of three each time, until the precise edit where the change was made is identified. You can also use the external WikiBlame tool, which automates this searching process.

Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"In the case of the Classic skin with quickbar, the diff page does not have the quickbar, to provide more space. Therefore, the diff page is also useful for viewing the page on full-screen width, without changing the preferences. With the Monobook skin the panels on the left are also on the diff page.
"
Help:Diff - Wikipedia,"On a diff page, sometimes the whole display might be wider than the screen window, often because some website URLs (especially long ones) are not hidden and do not wrap in a diff column. In such cases, you must then use the horizontal scrollbar of the browser to see the whole width of the display. There is no option to wrap the long lines in the diff display.

Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia project helping to create a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of openly editable content. The name ""Wikipedia"" is a blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning ""quick"") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Since its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors monthly as of November 2020[update]. It currently has more than 55 million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,214,178 articles in English with 131,217 active contributors in the past month.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"The fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Anyone is allowed to add or edit words, references, images, and other media here. What is contributed is more important than who contributes it. To remain, the content must be free of copyright restrictions and contentious material about living people. It must fit within Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable against a published reliable source. Editors' opinions and beliefs and unreviewed research will not remain. Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because the software allows easy reversal of mistakes, and many experienced editors are watching to ensure that edits are improvements. Begin by simply clicking the Edit button at the top of any editable page!
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. It is continually created and updated, with articles on new events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. Besides quantity, its contributors work on improving quality, removing or repairing misinformation, and other errors. Over time, articles tend to become more comprehensive and balanced. However, because anyone can click ""edit"" at any time and add content, any article may contain undetected misinformation, errors, or vandalism. Readers who are aware of this can obtain valid information, avoid recently added misinformation (see Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia), and fix the article.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of Nupedia, a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia, begun by the online media company Bomis. Nupedia had an elaborate system of peer review and required highly qualified contributors, but the writing of articles was slow. During 2000, Jimmy Wales (founder of Nupedia and co-founder of Bomis), and Larry Sanger, whom Wales had employed to work on the encyclopedia project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project. Multiple sources suggested that a wiki might allow public members to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January 10, 2001.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the wiki format, so the new project was given the name ""Wikipedia"" and launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January 15 (now called ""Wikipedia Day"" by some users). The bandwidth and server (in San Diego) were donated by Wales. Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on the project include Tim Shell, one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"In May 2001, a large number of non-English Wikipedias were launched—in Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. These were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian. In September,[2] Polish was added, and further commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made. At the end of the year, Afrikaans, Norwegian, and Serbo-Croatian versions were announced.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"The domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the Wikimedia Foundation was launched, in 2003, as its new parent organization with the "".org"" top-level domain denoting its not-for-profit nature. Today, there are Wikipedias in more than 300 languages.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Anyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages the inclusion of a tremendous amount of content. About 130,000 editors—from expert scholars to casual readers—regularly edit Wikipedia, and these experienced editors often help to create a consistent style throughout the encyclopedia, following our Manual of Style.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members carry out the important work of crafting a high-quality resource while maintaining civility. Editors can watch pages, and technically skilled persons can write editing programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits. Where there are disagreements on how to display facts, editors often work together to compile an article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject. Aspiring authors may wish to read the information on Contributing to Wikipedia before contributing to the project.

Information on the authorship of images and other media, such as sound files, can be found by clicking on the image itself or the nearby information icon to display the file page, which includes the author and source, where appropriate, along with other information.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Many visitors come to Wikipedia to acquire knowledge, while others come to share knowledge. At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and new articles are also being created. Changes can be viewed at the Recent changes page and a random page at random articles. 5,901 articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as featured articles, exemplifying the best articles in the encyclopedia. Another 32,986 articles are designated as good articles. Some information on Wikipedia is organized into lists; the best of these are designated as featured lists. Wikipedia also has portals, which organize content around topic areas. Articles can be found using the search box on the screen's top-right side.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is available in languages other than English. Wikipedia has more than 300 languages, including a Simple English version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service (see sister projects). All these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia articles are all cross-referenced. Highlighted text like this means ""click here"" for in-depth information. (Hovering is probably deep enough.) There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, navigational templates, and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information. Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information on our sister projects. Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"As wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved. Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information. Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argumentation, they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus. For a while, others may become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint that can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve better-balanced coverage of their subject. In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article they edit comprehensive. However, additional editors eventually expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage. Also, Wikipedia operates several internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach. Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"The ideal Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral, and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge. An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have. Our best articles are called Featured Articles (and display a small star in the upper right corner of the article), and our second-best tier of articles are designated Good Articles. However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through editors' concerted effort. Some articles contain statements that have not yet been fully cited. Others will later be augmented with new sections. Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source. Individual articles will vary in quality and maturity by their nature. Guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias. First, it is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Second, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles. Therefore, it has a vast pool of contributors: the whole world. This, and the first advantage mentioned above, have enabled Wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Third, a paper encyclopedia remains static (stays the same) and falls out of date until the next edition. But Wikipedia is dynamic: you don't have to wait for the next edition to come out (there are no editions), as Wikipedia is published on-line as it is written on-line. Articles are made available as is, regardless of what stage of development they are in. You can update Wikipedia at any instant. People do so continually around the clock, thereby helping each other keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and the latest facts in every subject.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Fourth, Wikipedia has a meager ""publishing"" cost for adding or expanding entries, as it is on-line, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution. This has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible to everyone. This has enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages simultaneously by people literate in each language. Of the 290+ different language Wikipedias, 137 of them have 10,000 or more articles.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Fifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact in some respects, since it never needs to be printed. However, computers have their own environmental cost.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Sixth, Wikipedia is extra-linear (more than linear). Instead of in-line explanations, Wikipedia incorporates hypertext in the form of wikilinks. Throughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility. The encyclopedia also has correlated to tables of contents and indexes, with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Seventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Eighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly, which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten. It is a community effort, with most people involved helping to improve the work, fixing problems they encounter along the way. See more about Wikipedia's strengths and weaknesses below ...
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences arise because it is open to anyone. According to editorial guidelines and policies, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"The MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes. Thus information added to Wikipedia never ""vanishes"" irreversibly. Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics. Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article. As with any source, the information should be checked. A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information (including search engines and the media), and may lead to ""a better sense of how to evaluate information sources."" [3]
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia. However, the consensus in Wikipedia is to put all disclaimers only as links and at the end of each article. Proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected. Some do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible errors in Wikipedia.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia, in common with many websites, has a disclaimer that, at times, has led to commentators citing these to support the view that Wikipedia is unreliable. A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable (including sources such as Encyclopædia Britannica, Associated Press, and the Oxford English Dictionary) can be read and compared at Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the Edit tab in an article, and editors are encouraged to be bold. To get started, the intro tutorial has helpful advice. Also, creating an account offers many benefits. Editors are expected to add only verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions, and to remain civil when discussing issues. Vandals will have their edits reverted and be blocked from editing.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Most articles start as stubs, but after many contributions, they can become featured articles. All editors are unpaid volunteers, including administrators, trusted editors who are given elevated permissions. The ease of editing Wikipedia results in many people editing. That makes updating the encyclopedia very quick. Every page has an associated talk page tab, where improvements to it are discussed.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual and various positive systems for continual article review and improvement. Examples of the processes include peer review, good article assessment, and the featured article process, a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality work.
"
Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia,"Besides, specific types of articles or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive projects, assessment processes (such as biographical article assessment), and expert reviewers within specific subjects. Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus on the neutral point of view noticeboard or in WikiProject Cleanup.

Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"Essays, as used by Wikipedia editors, typically contain advice or opinions of one or more Wikipedia contributors. The purpose of an essay is to aid or comment on the encyclopedia but not on any unrelated causes. Essays have no official status, and do not speak for the Wikipedia community as they may be created and edited without overall community oversight.  Following the instructions or advice given in an essay is optional. Generally soft advice belongs in an essay, thus avoiding instruction creep in Wikipedias official protocols. There are currently  about 2,000 essays on a wide range of Wikipedia-related topics. 
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"Although essays are not policies or guidelines, many are worthy of consideration. Policies and guidelines cannot cover all circumstances. Consequently many essays serve as interpretations of or commentary on perceived community norms for specific topics and situations. The value of an essay should be understood in context, using common sense and discretion. Essays can be written by anyone and can be long monologues or short theses, serious or funny. Essays may represent widespread norms or minority viewpoints.  An essay, as well as being useful, can potentially be a divisive means of espousing a point of view. Although an essay should not be used to create an alternative rule set, the Wikipedia community has historically tolerated a wide range of Wikipedia related subjects and viewpoints on user pages. 
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"The difference between policies, guidelines, and some essays on Wikipedia may be obscure. Essays vary in popularity and how much they are followed and referred to. Editors should defer to official policies or guidelines when essays, information pages or template documentation pages are inconsistent with established community standards and principles.
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"Avoid ""quoting"" essays as though they are policy—including this  explanatory supplement page. Essays, information pages and template documentation pages can be written without much—if any—debate, as opposed to Wikipedia policies that have been thoroughly vetted by the community (see WP:Local consensus for details). In Wikipedia discussions, editors may refer to essays provided that they do not hold them out as general consensus or policy. Proposals for new guidelines and policies require discussion and a high level of consensus from the entire community for promotion. See Wikipedia:How to contribute to Wikipedia guidance and Wikipedia:Policy writing is hard for more information. 
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"Essays are located in the  Wikipedia namespace (e.g., Wikipedia:Reasonability rule) and in User namespaces (e.g., User:Jimbo Wales/Statement of principles). The Help namespace contains pages which provide factual (usually technical) information on using Wikipedia and its software (see below). The {{Essay}}-family templates (with several variants like {{Notability essay}} and {{WikiProject advice}}), versus the {{Guideline}} (and variants, like {{MoS guideline}}) and {{Policy}} templates give an indication of a page's status within the community. Some essays at one time were proposed policies or guidelines, but they could not gain consensus overall; as indicated by the template {{Failed proposal}}. Other essays that at one time had consensus, but are no longer relevant, are tagged with the template {{Historical}}. Current essay policy nominations are indicated by the banner {{Proposed}}. See Wikipedia:Template messages/Wikipedia namespace for a listing of namespace banners.
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"Essays in the Wikipedia namespace – which are never to be put in the main (encyclopedia article) namespace – typically address some aspect of working in Wikipedia. They have not been formally adopted as guidelines or policies by the community at large, but typically edited by the community. Some are widely accepted as part of the Wikipedia gestalt, and have a significant degree of influence during discussions (like ""guideline supplements"" WP:Tendentious editing, WP:Bold, revert, discuss cycle, and WP:Competence is required). 
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"Many essays, however, are obscure, single-author pieces.  Essays may be moved into userspace as user essays (see below), or even deleted, if they are found to be problematic.[1]  Occasionally, even longstanding, community-edited essays may be removed or radically revised if community norms shift.[2]
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia's  how-to and information pages are typically edited by the community and can also be found in the help namespace. They generally  provide technical and factual information about Wikipedia  or supplement guidelines and policies in greater detail. Where ""essay pages""  often offer advice or opinions through viewpoints, information pages are intended  to clarity and explain current community practices in an impartial way (e.g.,  Wikipedia:Administration). 
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"WikiProjects are groups of editors who like working together. Advice pages written by these groups are formally considered the same as pages written by anyone else, that is, they are essays unless and until they have been formally adopted as community-wide guidelines or policies. WikiProjects are encouraged to write essays explaining how the community's policies and guidelines should be applied to their areas of interest and expertise (e.g.,  Wikipedia:WikiProject Bibliographies#Recommended structure).
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"According to Wikipedia policy, ""Essays that the author does not want others to edit, or that are found to contradict widespread consensus, belong in the user namespace.""  These are similar to essays placed in the Wikipedia namespace; however, they are often authored/edited by only one person, and may represent a strictly personal viewpoint about Wikipedia or its processes (e.g., User:Jehochman/Responding to rudeness). Some of them are widely respected by other editors, and even occasionally have an effect on policy (e.g., the WP:General notability guideline originated in a user essay). Writings that contradict policy are somewhat tolerated within the User namespace. The author of a personal essay located in his or her user space has the prerogative to revert any changes made to it by any other user, within reason.  Polemics against particular people, or against Wikipedia itself, are generally just deleted, as unconstructive or disruptive.
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"The Wikimedia Foundation's Meta-wiki was envisioned as the original place for editors to comment on and discuss Wikipedia, although the ""Wikipedia"" project space has since taken over most of that role. Many historical essays can still be found at Meta.Wikimedia.org.
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"Before creating an essay, it is a good idea to check if similar essays already exist. Although there is no guideline or policy that explicitly prohibits it, writing redundant essays is discouraged. Avoid creating essays just to prove a point or game the system. Essays that violate one or more Wikipedia policies, such as spam, personal attacks, copyright violations, or what Wikipedia is not  tend to get deleted or transferred to user space.
"
Wikipedia:Essays - Wikipedia,"You do not have to have created an essay to improve it. If an essay already exists, you can add to, remove from, or modify it as you wish, provided that you use good judgment. However, essays placed in the User: namespace are often—though not always—meant to represent the viewpoint of one user only. You should usually not substantively edit someone else's user essay without permission. To be on the safe side, discuss any edits not covered by REFACTOR and MINOR before making them. If the original author is no longer active or available, seek consensus on the essay's talk page (other editors who have worked on the essay are likely to care about it), or just write a new one.

Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,"Don't-give-a-fuckism (""DGAFism"") is an ism concerned mainly with not giving a fuck. This is not a joke; it's as serious an endeavor as anything else.

Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,"It is easier to get a sincere 'thank you' for reverting [a slur] from someone's userpage, than it is for writing a researched, thorough, and referenced encyclopedia article on an encyclopedic topic. The best way to continue as a writing Wikipedian for many years is to be 'indifferent to both praise and blame.' Indifference to praise is a hard task for mere humans, but millions of potential anonymous readers demand it of you, for if you require praise you will burn out ..."
Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,"Suffering (conflict and stress) is caused by attachment (giving a fuck) and can be relieved by detachment (not giving a fuck).

Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,Not giving a fuck improves your quality of life significantly by drastically reducing your capabilities of giving a fuck.
Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,"""Don't give a fuck"" originated from England, originally used as ""Don't care a rap for"". A rap was a half-penny, or a very low denomination. ""Don't care a — for"" means that you wouldn't sacrifice even this very small thing for whatever it is you are talking about. Variations of the phrase include ""Don't give a rat's ass"" or ""Couldn't care less"". A common Irish variant ""Ah sure, it'll be grand"" literally rejects the possibility that something bad will happen. This is a good example of not giving a fuck being far more than a reductive approach to stress. The origins of this phrase are shrouded in mystery, presumably because no one could be arsed to write it all down—and even if they did, sure, who'd give a fuck?
"
Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,"Indirect variations include DILLIGAF (""Do I look like I give a fuck?""), ""You could cry me a river"", ""Blow it out your butt"", ""Tell somebody who cares"", or ""My heart is bleeding"", basically meaning that any damaging of the subject's credibility is accepted. Another option is the phrase ""I think you're mistaking me for somebody sitting under the I Care Sign"". This phrase is difficult to work into ordinary conversation, but enormously satisfying when you can. Many DGAFers are skilled players of the world's smallest violin.
"
Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,"One can even extend the wording by suggesting that you would rather do anything else but care, such as I will spend the time that I would have spent on this doing something more useful and entertaining, like maybe gouging my eyes out with forks.

Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,"Using DGAF as rationalization for a dickish action is an abuse of the live-and-let-live ethos of don't-give-a-fuckism. Behaving like an angry mastodon, perhaps stemming from excessively possessive feelings toward an article you have created or edited, is symptomatic of caring too much. Take a deep breath. Count to ten. Consider moving on. Better yet, count down from 10—after promising yourself that from the moment you reach zero you will move on.

Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuckism - Wikipedia,"DGAFism is not to be confused with nihilism. You have to really care to commit deeply to a negative view of life. Likewise, being deliberately sloppy in your editing and sourcing is an abuse of Wikipedia, and has nothing to do with true DGAFism.

Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"In Wikipedia discussions, editors point to similarities across the project as reasons to keep, delete, or create a particular type of content, article or policy. These ""other stuff exists"" arguments can be valid or invalid.
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"When used correctly, these comparisons are important as the encyclopedia should be consistent in the content that it provides or excludes. For example, harmonizing file names of a set of images is a valid rationale for renaming files (to a lesser degree, this applies to article titles as well, although article naming is more complex). Trouble arises when legitimate comparisons are disregarded without thought or consideration of the Wikipedia:Five pillars.
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"As this essay tries to stimulate people to use sound arguments related to existing notability policies and guidelines in deletion discussions, and also to consider otherwise valid matters of precedent and consistency, it is important to realize that countering the keep or delete arguments of other people, or dismissing them outright, by simply referring them to this essay by name, and nothing else, is not encouraged. (For a similar issue, see Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions.)
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"The claim of ""other stuff exists"" most often arises in article deletion debate, where it is often used in the following manner. Examples:
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"A variant of the ""other stuff exists"" argument is to cite a specific Featured article.
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"The nature of Wikipedia means that you cannot make a convincing argument based solely on what other articles do or do not exist, because there is nothing stopping anyone from creating any article (except for a salting). Even our basic inclusion rules, such as notability and the use of reliable sources, don't actually provide a mechanism to stop somebody from trying to create an article about a topic that fails them — those rules govern whether or not the article is allowed on Wikipedia once it's here, but they do not actually make it impossible for someone to start an article about a non-notable topic in the first place. And even when such an article does get created, the more responsible editors have to actually see it before it can get dealt with. 
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"While these comparisons are not a conclusive test, they may form part of a cogent argument; an entire comment should not be dismissed because it includes a comparative statement like this. Plenty of articles exist that probably should not. Equally, a lot of articles do not exist that probably should. Therefore, just pointing out that an article on a similar subject exists does not prove that the article in question should also exist; it is quite possible that the other article should also be deleted but nobody has noticed it. However, threats to actually put these other articles forward for AfD after a debate closes may be interpreted as all-or-nothing reasoning. Sometimes arguments are made that other articles have been put forward for AfD and survived/deleted (the most famous example being the Pokémon test); these may be effective arguments, but even here caution should be used.
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"In general, these deletion debates should focus mainly on the nominated article. In consideration of precedent and consistency, though, identifying articles of the same nature that have been established and continue to exist on Wikipedia may provide extremely important insight into the general concept of notability, levels of notability (what's notable: international, national, regional, state, provincial?), and whether or not a level and type of article should be on Wikipedia. When an editor introduces a novel type of article in Wikipedia, it may be necessary, however, to consider whether such organization of material is compliant with core policies such as neutral point of view and no original research. Other editors may argue that a certain type of article doesn't exist because of inherent violations of said policies; see WP:ATTACK for example. Dismissing such concerns simply by pointing to this essay is inappropriate.
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"Deletion debates can sometimes be faulty; even if the debate was correct, it can be hard to draw comparisons: would the fact that there is an article on every Grey's Anatomy character mean there necessarily should be an article on every character on The Office? Comparisons can be highly subjective, and so it is better to look at the debates in question and see what policies were cited and make an argument based on how they apply to the current debate than just say ""x was kept so this should be too"". However, a small number of debates do receive wide participation and result in a decision that is effectively final, until new evidence comes along. If you reference such a past debate, and it is clearly a very similar case to the current debate, this can be a strong argument that should not be discounted because of a misconception that this section is a blanket ban on ever referencing other articles or deletion debates.
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"Note as well that people have sometimes tried to raise ""other stuff exists"" arguments by comparing their article to a non-equivalent situation — for example, the fact that we have an article about Hillary Clinton, even though she did not win the 2016 United States presidential election, has actually been attempted more than once as an argument for why we would need to keep an article about a person notable only as a non-winning candidate for a smalltown city council. What these arguments miss is that Hillary Clinton already held several other notable political offices before running for president, and thus qualifies for an article regardless of her victory or defeat in one individual election. It is important, accordingly, to realize that if you're seeking to establish an article's includability by comparing it to what other articles do or don't exist, you need to look at equivalent topics: if your topic's most notable accomplishment is that she ran for city council and lost, then look to see if we have any significant number of articles about other losing city council candidates. (Spoiler alert: we don't.)
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia recognizes that it suffers from systemic bias (see WP:BIAS). Sometimes the nomination of one of a series of articles that have relatively equal merit would further the bias (e.g., deletion of Fooian this but not XYZian this if XYZian represents the culture of the majority on Wikipedia) – note that this argument differs from Fooian this vs. Fooian that or Fooian this vs. XYZian that.
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"When applied to creation of articles, this concept must demonstrate that articles of a similar nature and construct are included throughout Wikipedia. For instance:
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"Be wary of this logic, though, across topics of differing similarities. The same is not necessarily applicable to vastly different core topics or to every aspect of a topic. For example:
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"While the Wikipedia community discusses the concept of ""inherent notability""—meaning that there is a class of subjects in which every subject in the class could have a stand-alone Wikipedia article—the concept is in limited practice through the use of precedent.
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"As an example, generally speaking, any television station is very likely to be deemed sufficiently notable for an article, but lower-level schools are generally not. While not a hard-and-fast rule, this is the status quo for Wikipedia inclusion and is consistently maintained through discussions of various schools, school districts, and their creatability and keepability (or lack thereof). Thus ""inherent notability"" is basically codification of ""other stuff exists"".
"
Wikipedia:Other stuff exists - Wikipedia,"This essay is not a standard reply that can be hurled against anyone you disagree with who has made a reference to how something is done somewhere else. Though a lot of Wikipedia's styles are codified in policy, to a large extent minor details are not. In cases such as these, an ""other stuff exists""–type of argument or rationale may provide the necessary precedent for style and phraseology.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Articles on Wikipedia must conform to a neutral point of view, being neutral in both content and in form. Editors have had many successes in dealing with non-neutral content, by verifying facts to confirm that they are supported by reliable sources, ensuring that one viewpoint is not given undue weight and removing (or properly attributing) opinions. However, Wikipedia has greater difficulty with achieving neutrality in form, as it is not always obvious how the structure of an article can favor undue weight on a single perspective.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Some forms and structures, such as the use of ""Criticism of..."" or ""Controversies regarding..."" article titles or section headings often lead to disputes over point of view (POV). This essay suggests better practices to use in their place.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"The structure of an article can result in emphasizing some information more than others, which has implications for due weight. For example, information that is placed at the beginning of an article (the lead) is inherently being emphasized more than information that is placed later. The same is true for placement of information within a sentence, paragraph, or section. On the other hand, placement at the end of a paragraph or section may be interpreted as a conclusion or the ""last word"", and readers may be more likely to remember it. Information in the middle of a paragraph or section is emphasized the least, especially when the paragraph or section is long, and may even be skipped entirely by some of the readers.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Since most people do not read the entire article, information earlier in the article is also more likely to be read, so earlier placement carries more weight for this reason as well. In fact, many people only read the lead, making the lead especially important for ensuring neutrality, and editors should make sure that the lead follows WP:LEAD and WP:SUMMARYSTYLE. Similarly, the order of sections in an article may hold implications for the relative importance of topics. In general, placing a section earlier may imply that it is more central to the overall subject of the article. Starting with ""Definition"" or ""History"" as the first section (after the lead) is usually neutral, but starting with ""Criticism"" is usually not. Different choices of ordering within a section or paragraph may also frame certain parts as rebuttals to other parts, and any such implications should be justified by the sources.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Additional forms of emphasis (which may or may not be warranted, as determined by due weight) include placing information in shorter paragraphs or image captions, where readers are more likely to notice it. 
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Even if the text of an article follows the NPOV guidelines, it is possible to introduce POV and bias into the headings. In some cases, articles about a famous singer or actor will have subheadings such as ""Rise to fame"", ""Increasing acclaim"" and ""International superstardom"". When one sees a sequence of subtitles like this, one wonders what is next–""Ascent to supreme glory""! In the case of the three subtitles presented previously, a neutral way of subtitling the sections of this singer or actor's article could be ""1970s"", ""1980s"" and ""1990s"". Another option could be to use neutral words that reference major structural points in the individual's life, such as ""Early career"", ""London years"" and ""Move to Los Angeles"".
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"POV in subheadings can also be negative in tone. For example, a rock singer's article would have POV in the subheadings if they read ""Early career"", ""Criticism from music journalists"" and ""Fan backlash"".
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Organizations, governments, corporations, religions and living notable individuals are all constantly evolving and changing. When writing about a phenomenon that has changed over time, use a ""History"" section with chronological headings to present information in a neutral form.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Writing about an evolving concept in sections will allow readers to understand its evolution. This includes the initial intentions and reactions to the concept, how the concept changed as it impacted the world, and the current status of the concept. This also allows periods of extreme success or failure to be presented in a historic context. 
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Beware of editors who are opposed to writing about an evolving concept in a chronological structure. Some may intentionally do this so that one part of history can gain undue weight over another, to present that topic in its most negative or positive light. Even if done unintentionally, failing to distinguish between historic facts and current facts will make it difficult for readers to understand how a concept has changed over time.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"In some cases, however, an article may be structured in a non-chronological structure for reasons that are not related to POV. For example, in the case of a celebrity who has worked professionally as a singer, actor and model, the article might have sections entitled ""Singing"", ""Acting"" and ""Modeling."" In this case, the use of a non-chronological structure is used to present the three different sides to the individual's career.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"The following is a list of red flags that may help identify reasons why an article suffers from constant debate and POV-pushing. Not all red flags are indicative of a problem. This list should be taken as a way to begin a discussion, and find ways to change the fundamental form of an article to ensure a more neutral point of view.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"""Criticism of..."" articles inherently focus on the negative aspects of a phenomenon. By virtue of its title, praise for that same phenomenon is out of place. One man's trash is another man's treasure, but the article is inherently designed to focus on the first man's opinion to the exclusion of the other man. It makes it difficult to represent ""fairly, proportionately, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views"", in accordance with the policy on neutral point of view. ""Criticism of..."" articles may be considered to be a WP:POV fork.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"This is less of a problem for ""criticism of..."" sections within articles, but these may still lead to undue weight on the negative aspects of a phenomenon. Likewise, ""praise of..."" articles and sections may run into the same issues.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"The best way to provide context is to re-frame the article, beginning with the topic. ""Reception of..."" allows praise and criticism to be provided in context with each other. Creating an article or section about a phenomenon's reception is not meant to be a complete list of all praise and criticism, but to provide readers with a representative sample of how that phenomenon has been received. 
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"It is typically better to add context to criticism articles than to delete them. Consider revising ""criticism"" with a proportional amount of ""praise"", or up-merging the ""criticism"" back into the main article.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"A related type of article or section is ones titled ""Controversies regarding..."". Where there is already an article on XYZ, creating a new article entitled ""Controversies regarding XYZ"" may be viewed as a POV fork. That said, there are some articles with this type of title, such as List of Wikipedia controversies. Creating a subsection within the article on XYZ entitled ""Controversies"" is also a potential problem, because it may still lead to undue weight on the negative aspects of the topic. In many cases, if there are noteworthy controversies that received significant and sustained media coverage during in a biographical figure's life or a company's history, these can briefly summarized in the biography or history as part of the general text.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"One way to control a debate is to control the use of language. In George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the repressive government promotes ""newspeak"" as a language to control how its subjects talk about the world. In real-world politics, different parties use language to frame the parameters of the debate. This tactic of using ""loaded language"" has risen with the growing power of marketeers.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"A notable example of this tactic is the debate over the legalization of abortion. Supporters of legal abortion describe themselves as ""pro choice"", thus allowing them to describe their opponents as being against choice. Critics of legal abortion describe themselves as ""pro life"", thus allowing them to describe their opponents as being against life. This difficulty can be avoided by side-stepping these labels, and writing articles about ""support for the legalization of abortion"" and ""opposition to the legalization of abortion"".
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia makes it a policy to avoid writing articles about neologisms and other terms invented recently. This is seldom an issue for new scientific terminology. It is more problematic for terminology popularized in the political arena, or around other public figures. 
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"One solution would be to rename the article to a scientific term, or to use a short description to unpack the term. Another option is to merge the article about the term into a section of an article about the larger topic. If the term is sufficiently popular to write a full article about it from reliable sources, it is preferable to balance perspectives from sources that talk about the term, and avoid giving weight to sources that merely use the term.
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia articles cover controversies. However, not all controversies are covered equally, and some not at all. It is sensible to cover a controversy when someone is accused of a crime and they are convicted. It is typically reasonable to cover criminal disputes even if someone is found to be innocent, if the trial became notable to reliable journalists and scholars. But in instances where a criminal accusation is found to be completely without merit, writing about it in Wikipedia may only give undue weight to a frivolous complaint. 
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"This is even more difficult for writing about accusations that someone notable lied or behaved inappropriately. Journalists may spend several weeks examining a debate over whether someone lied, which inevitably leads to a discussion about the magnitude of that lie, and whether they should apologize. Ten different columns in newspapers does not mean that the incident should be covered in its own section, or at all. 
"
Wikipedia:Be neutral in form - Wikipedia,"When writing about a topic, only write about controversies that had a lasting impact.
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"Disagreement is common on Wikipedia.  Editors, even highly experienced ones, sometimes disagree on important interpretations of policies and guidelines.  There are subtleties and backwaters and little-known guides that can baffle editors who had finally gotten comfortable with ""how things work"".  This happens most often in deletion discussions, whether within the discussions themselves or on the talk pages of the participants outside of the discussions, since the idea of deleting Wikipedia content is one of the most divisive, emotional, and personal things that happens here.
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"One of the techniques by which an editor can attempt to gain the upper hand in such discussion is through the use of the word ""clearly"".  Even when it is true, ""clearly"" suggest that others must be opaque or thick.  It is a way of insulting those involved in a discussion who disagree with you by suggesting that their efforts or thoughts are obtuse.  It is a way of railroading a conversation.  At its core, ""clearly"" is rude.
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"The fact is, if whatever was at stake were truly ""clear"", then the discussion at hand would probably not be taking place (which is what the use of ""clearly"" is implying— that the discussion should not be taking place, even though it is).  Here's an example: ""Subject clearly meets WP:RARETOPIC paragraph 2 and WP:NSTUFF sentences 21 and 28 plus footnote 4"".  That statement may or may not be true, but prefacing it with the word ""clearly"" implies that the opposition was either ignorant about or alternatively must have known about those criteria and was acting in bad faith by not mentioning them.  Either way, it neither helpful nor necessary.
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"Along with the use of ""clearly"" is the expression ""You may want to review basic guideline ABC.""  This, too, is insulting because it condescendingly insinuates ignorance.  The same information can be communicated with, ""I am looking at guideline ABC.""  That phrasing communicates the same information without telling others what to do.  If the opposition is not familiar with that guideline, they will probably look it up immediately— no suggestions to do so will be necessary, although it might make you feel good to have had a chance to condescend.
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"It is also important to keep in mind that all editors make mistakes.  Sometimes an article is nominated for deletion without the nominator being fully aware of the criteria for that particular kind of article; sometimes the person refuting a deletion nomination may forget that the subject-specific criteria for one article do not apply to certain others.  If you notice this and want to point it out so that the editor can be aware of it and won't make the same mistake again, there are many ways to do this without saying, ""You may want to review...""  
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"Consider phrasing it like this: ""My interpretation of guideline FOO is that articles like this one should be retained on the basis of BAR.  What do you think?""  This suggests the editor is perhaps already aware of guideline FOO (which may or may not be the case, but that's not the point) and may even have an opinion about which you are not aware— soliciting an opinion on the matter is a very friendly way to see what the other editor is thinking, and also allows that editor an easy out: ""Oh, you know, I wasn't even aware of guideline FOO— perhaps I made a mistake.""  Instead of an angry escalation of the matter, the two editors might even become colleagues.  That will never happen if one starts off the interaction by telling the other what to do.
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"We don't all have time on Wikipedia to engage in every social nicety that usually accompanies verbal social interaction.  Sometimes Wikipedia commentary is necessarily curt in order to get the job done.  In that line of reasoning, words like ""clearly"" are only extraneous verbiage which are likely to inflame the other party while trying to win a case by silencing the opposition.  Following it with ""you may want to review"" is just bitter icing on a frosty cake that no one wants to eat: at its core, it is a violation of the basic Wikipedia rules regarding civility and courtesy.  
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"It is obviously important to point to the guidelines or policies you are using to support your own arguments— it is never necessary as a corollary that you ""suggest"" others review those guidelines or policies in order to finally catch up with the rest of ""us"" who are so very far ahead of you in understanding what is really going on here.  The only thing ""clear"" is that a discussion is, in fact, taking place, and the only things that need to be suggested for review are the means by which that discussion can be concluded without editors insulting each other's intelligence.  Some editors are newer than others, but there are plenty of statistics to show that none of us is exactly stupid. Considering the appalling rate at which Wikipedia has become unable to attract and retain new, competent editors, we would all be better off if we behaved as though that were a shared belief.
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"As another view, there is often a need in a discussion for saying that a particular argument is not just wrong but very wrong, or for saying that something is not just notable but is very notable, to the extent that saying otherwise is not just an error of judgement, but a definite mistake. A  variety of wordings can be used to say this:  clearly, very, obviously, unmistakably,  plainly. They are just intensifiers.  They express the degree of the speaker's view on the matter and are just as valid as using words such as barely,  possibly,  conceivably , probably and the like.    There's a whole spectrum of meaning, and saying where something falls in the spectrum is clarification, not insult...  Or at least, may not be intended as one.  Consider the following:
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"The Simpsons, season 11, BABF 14:
The scene: a birthday party is being held for Barney Gumble, the town drunk, at the Simpsons' house.  Gumble, intoxicated, is talking to Lisa Simpson.

Barney: ""I'm just saying that when we die there's going to be a planet for the French, a planet for the Chinese, and we'll all be a lot happier.""

Lisa: ""Mr. Gumble, you are upsetting me.""  

Barney: ""No, I'm not.""
<http://www.lardlad.com/assets/quotes/season11/BABF14.shtml >
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"But the sense of upset is not determined by the person making the statement, it is determined by the person receiving it.  One person's emphasis may be experienced as insult, and that is where editors need to be careful.  Emphasis, like a planet for the French, is not always needed.  In fact, if the statement which follows the intensifier is true in and of itself, emphasis should be completely unnecessary: like a good Wikipedia article, it should stand on its own and its factuality be evident in its citations.
"
Wikipedia:Nothing is clear - Wikipedia,"We have tendencies as humans to pass on to others the treatment that we ourselves have received.  If we have been insulted, we will tend to pass on insults; if we have been treated as ignorant, we will tend to treat others as ignorant.  Information itself is not always retained— what is retained is how we felt about it, and is what we pass on.  As you consider your own use of the word ""clearly"" in a Wikipedia discussion, ask yourself, ""How do I suppose I would feel if I were the person for whom this sentence is intended?"" as well as, ""Do I need this here?  Am I saying it this way to make myself feel good?""  If you can feel good about your answers to both questions, then when we die, we will all be a lot happier!

Wikipedia:Oversimplification - Wikipedia,"Oversimplification seems to be a significant problem for Wikipedia. It seems to be worst in the lead sections of articles, especially where they include definitions, and in articles on broad topics. This kind of content seems to be particularly likely to contain inaccurate or misleading generalisations. In such cases, oversimplification may result from the difficulty of producing a summary of a large body of text that is both concise and accurate.
"
Wikipedia:Oversimplification - Wikipedia,"Oversimplification may result from a failure to write from a neutral point of view (presenting one point of view as if it was the only one that existed),[1] from the inclusion of original research (particularly misrepresentation of the content of sources)[2] or from the use of unreliable sources, such as using general dictionaries for the definitions of terms of art. 
"
Wikipedia:Oversimplification - Wikipedia,"Oversimplification also includes completely omitting a topic within an article merely because it is felt that it is inherently incapable of being explained in a way that a person of average intelligence or education would understand, or omitting subject matter that is necessary for a complete understanding of the whole of the topic of which it is part,[3] merely because it is felt that the subject matter will only be of interest to academics or ""specialists"".[4]

Wikipedia:Oversimplification - Wikipedia,"Oversimplified Wikipedia content should be rewritten so that it is accurate and does not mislead. It might, however, be eligible for inclusion in Wikiversity. A further corollary of the policy is that Wikipedia is not a children's encyclopedia.

Wikipedia:Concession - Wikipedia,"In the course of editorial discussions, the concept of a concession means simply to be courteous and to explicitly ""surrender"", rather than leave a lost argument and indicate a concession only through implication, or by allowing idle time to pass.

Wikipedia:Concession - Wikipedia,"Making a concession signals to others that adversarial debate has closed and parties can then move on toward constructive tasks.
"
Wikipedia:Concession - Wikipedia,"Making explicit concessions also shows good faith. Often in the course of arguments we encounter valid counterarguments. Rather than be antagonistic or adversarial, concede what is valid to such counterarguments. This shows not only good faith, and civility, but that you are oriented toward achieving consensus, and in fact it makes your argument stronger if you can respond effectively to every such counterargument. Naturally there will be cases in which you find a counterargument to be superior to your own, and such counterarguments may in fact change your own thinking. Rather than simply walk away, give concession to your opponent(s) by stating clearly that they have won the argument through logic, reason, and clarity of concept.

Once you've completed your work, move it to the main namespace where articles reside. Remember, there is no deadline. Take your time to create a well-crafted, well-referenced article before introducing it to others. This is especially true of biographies which are subject to higher sourcing standards than non-biographies, due to WP:BLP rules, articles on medical or psychological topics (which require all statements to be sourced to high-quality sources, such as university textbooks), and articles that aren't going to garner lots of contributions from other editors immediately.
"
Wikipedia:Editors are not mindreaders - Wikipedia,"The Draft namespace can also be used.
"
Wikipedia:Editors are not mindreaders - Wikipedia,"If you must create the article in the main article space, because you feel that the article is urgently needed, consider adding the {{underconstruction}} tag to the top of the article. This timestamped tag lets other Wikipedia editors know that it is a work-in-progress that you intend to improve in the very near future. This approach works well when you will complete your planned work on the article within a day or two. If your plans stretch out over several days or weeks, consider using your userspace.
"
Wikipedia:Editors are not mindreaders - Wikipedia,"If you want to create an article that is likely to be controversial, you may even wish to create it offline (e.g. in Microsoft Word), save it on your personal computer, and not put it into Wikipedia until there is a strong reference for every claim, and you are confident that the article is worded in a sufficiently WP:NPOV manner so that it won't be AfD'd immediately. If you create a draft in your user space and it is deemed to be problematic, it can be deleted under the ""Miscellany for Deletion"" (WP:MFD) guidelines.

"
Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"We can afford to take our time, to consider matters, to wait before creating a new article until its significance is unambiguously established. If you need help with something, do not be afraid to ask for help in the teahouse. If you post the article before it is ready another editor may submit your article for deletion. 
"
Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is not Wikinews and has no need to scoop anyone. Turn this into a strength by working on your article in your userspace or scratchpad until you have the best possible article, fully referenced, a masterpiece of neutrality. And if someone beats you to it, makes that first place in the edit history, so what? Merge in what you have and turn a stub or whatever into a good article. Wikipedia is not a competition either.
"
Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"Above all, creating an article without establishing the basis of the content and its significance is a bad idea. There really are no points for being first; being the author of the best and most neutral content will earn you far greater kudos.

Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"We can afford to take our time to improve articles, to wait before deleting a new article unless its potential significance  cannot be established.
"
Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia and has no need to work towards a deadline. There is no finished version expected soon, and it is perfectly acceptable to let the editing process fashion an article up to our standards eventually. And if it takes a long time for that process to work, so what? Wikipedia is a work in progress, and will always remain so. There is no publication date and Wikipedia does not have to be finished today. It merely needs to have improved on yesterday. Perfection is neither desired nor achievable.
"
Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"Remember also that consensus can change over time. New people may bring fresh ideas, established users may change their minds when new things come up, and we all may find a better way to do things.
"
Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"Above all, the principle of creating an article which is unfinished was once a consequence of the now historical second rule of Wikipedia, Always leave something undone (though the present procedural policy no longer discusses this). By creating an unfinished article, you encourage other people to contribute; collaboration on articles will earn you far greater respect than solo editing.
"
Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"
"
Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"Whether the addition/removal to the article can be justified or not, it is sometimes better to handle the dispute at the time it occurs. Generally referenced additions can be viewed and evaluated by other users more easily, since it is much easier than tracking the additions / removals from article history, and generally ""let it go"" cases are forgotten after a while, unless an editor bothers to check every single entry in article history. Also discussing cases after a while may consume much more time than early solved conflicts since non-solved conflicts generally turn out as personal conflicts between editors. Moreover, since editors try to edit in their free time where they can do anything else, they may not find such time in the future to edit or discuss these matters to improve Wikipedia. And it is frequent that some users act WP:POV or WP:BIASed (and WP:Systemic bias in the worst cases) because of their political or religious views or they may not have any expertise in the article they edit. From time to time they may have WP:COI, or act like they WP:OWN the article, they may take things personally and may not be WP:POLITE (verbally or worse with their editing style) so, whether or not you assume WP:GOODFAITH, you may not come to an agreement. At those times, you may seek third party review help from uninvolved editors to come to an agreement between both parties.

Wikipedia:There is no deadline - Wikipedia,"Editors shouldn't get upset when they lose the opportunity to create a new article. No one owns an article. When you miss out on a chance to create a new article, instead of feeling robbed or slighted or considering acts of vengeance, you might look and see if there's any way you can still contribute.

Wikipedia:How to be civil - Wikipedia,"Incivility creates a hot, unfriendly space, and a sense of threat. With civility, respect and a sense of safety and collegiality between all concerned is created, producing ample room for negotiation. Incivility may put editors on the defensive, may create closed-mindedness to multiple, alternative ideas, and can help to prevent a consensus from forming.
"
Wikipedia:How to be civil - Wikipedia,"A more serious consequence of incivility may be that an editor becomes so unhappy that they leave Wikipedia. Wikipedia is at heart an online community. To maintain the effectiveness of the community, all members must be civil to one another and remember why they have joined the community in the first place. Editors should strive to create an environment that supports other editors and that does not encourage or support breaches of incivility. All contributors are expected to assume good faith towards each other (within reason), in order to try to uphold a reasonably civil atmosphere.
"
Wikipedia:How to be civil - Wikipedia,"Editors can apply peer pressure by voicing displeasure each time rudeness or incivility occurs; however, some care is required: If the comment is read as an insult, or seems to belittle another editor; the situation could be inflamed further. Peer pressure works best when it comes from friends or people the editor already trusts or respects.

Wikipedia:Advice for parents - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia's goal is to offer knowledge for many different things, in a format which is legal to copy, modify, and redistribute (copyleft, as we call it) to all, at no cost. We hope you will find huge educational value within this project; and among our millions of articles, you will certainly find many relevant to almost all areas of study. No encyclopedia should be the end of the line in any research, however, and we hope you'll find our articles useful road maps for further exploration across a whole range of subjects. Although there are policies and guidelines for content, Wikipedia is freely editable by everyone, so inaccuracy and vandalism are problems that the project faces on a daily basis. A number of safeguards are in effect. These include insisting that editors cite reliable sources, as well as Recent Changes Patrolling for vandalism, and New Page Patrolling for recently created articles with inappropriate content.

Wikipedia:Advice for parents - Wikipedia,"This page and its subpages (linked pages) are intended to help parents, guardians, teachers, and other adults consider the best way to allow children they are responsible for to engage with Wikipedia safely and enjoyably. There is also a development area at Child protection. Read more about privacy, confidentiality and discretion on Wikipedia.
"
Wikipedia:Advice for parents - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is not censored, which in practice means that in relevant areas throughout the site, you will find possibly distressing or offensive content and pictures showing subjects like violence, nudity, sexual activity or controversial topics. Such material is present in a small percentage of articles. Editors range widely both in age and in cultural background, and as such, profanity is also prevalent in some areas of content and discussions. See Wikipedia:Uncensored and Wikipedia:Offensive material for more information.

Wikipedia:Advice for parents - Wikipedia,"Pages which are normally appropriate for children to view, like articles about cartoon characters or books written for young readers, may be vandalized with rude words or content which may be considered offensive and inappropriate for some younger readers. Vandalism is normally noticed and removed within a few minutes, if not seconds (via the recent changes function, or via an automated bot); but sometimes it can remain unnoticed for days, and even if not, someone will have to see it before it can be removed, and this could be anyone. If you see vandalism, please report it (or even have a try at editing the page yourself!).

Wikipedia:Advice for parents - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia does not engage in a ""working with children"" check on editors, and it is possible for any editor to communicate with any other either on the wiki or via email, if the editor has an email account registered with Wikipedia (this feature can be disabled in your Preferences). This communication may not be monitored by other Wikipedia editors, and we strongly advise all editors not to publish private information such as full contact details. Accidental publication of personal or contact detail can be removed by requesting oversight, a form of hiding information so that it can only be viewed by only a group of especially trusted people, known as arbitrators or oversighters. They have signed a legal agreement with the Wikimedia Foundation, and if they disclose oversighted information without permission from foundation staff, severe sanctions will be imposed. For legal reasons, nothing inside our database is permanently deleted.

Wikipedia:Advice for parents - Wikipedia,"Most communication on Wikipedia occurs in an open, public, reviewable manner – even personal ""talk page"" messages are readable by anybody. Note, however, that contrary to some sites directed towards youth, the staff of the Wikimedia Foundation (who run Wikipedia) do not regularly patrol discussion pages or remove inappropriate comments; it only has volunteer administrators, who may exclude people breaching civility rules, but who will not censor conversations, even if they deal with adult topics.

Wikipedia:Advice for parents - Wikipedia,"Children and their parents must understand that any person, no matter how well- or ill-motivated, is free to participate in the project. While some child-focused online communities will remove members who are found/suspected of being dangerous towards children in the ""real/offline"" world, Wikipedia does not, as a rule, require users to disclose their identities, and hence cannot remove them according to anything that pertains to identity, including criminal or sex-offender records. A child, or anyone else, should never assume that if somebody has an account on Wikipedia, then they're safe to meet in person. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia project, not a social networking web site. Common sense must be applied where it most pertains, and in particular it must be remembered that anyone can pass themselves off as anyone on the Internet.

Wikipedia:Requests for oversight - Wikipedia,"Wikipedia has a strict privacy policy  that means we only allow an edit, once it is suppressed, to be viewed by a small, vetted, and identified team of highly-trusted users (the ""Oversighters"").

Wikipedia:Requests for oversight - Wikipedia,"An example of one instance where an edit was exceptionally suppressed was an edit made as part of a real-world stalking campaign, where the edit had no project value, and where no lesser remedy was sufficient.

If we deny your request, you can instead request speedy deletion or revision deletion.

"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"A shortcut is a specialized type of redirect page that provides an abbreviated wikilink to an administrative page  or one of its sections, usually from the Wikipedia namespace or Help namespace. These shortcuts' abbreviations in all-caps text are commonly used (linked or unlinked) on community pages and talk pages, but should not be used in articles themselves. If there is one or more shortcuts for a page or section, one or more will usually be chosen to be displayed in an information box on the right labelled Shortcut or Shortcuts, as can be seen at the top of this page.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Shortcuts are created for the convenience of editors. It is possible to create a shortcut for any page at all. The existence of a shortcut does not imply or prove that the linked page is a policy or guideline.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Lists of available shortcuts can be found at:
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"A Wikipedia shortcut can be entered into the Wikipedia search box to quickly bring you to a project page. For example, you can type WP:R or H:R into the search box and then press the enter key (or click the magnifying glass icon), to get to the Wikipedia:Redirect page, instead of having to type in the complete phrase. 
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Alternatively, you can use a shortcut in the URL in your browser's address bar. For example, you are currently viewing the Wikipedia:Shortcut page. The URL for this page is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut. You could then get from here to the Wikipedia:Redirect page by replacing Wikipedia:Shortcut with WP:R in the address bar, followed by pressing the enter key. (If your browser has relative URL entry, simply prefix the shortcut with ./ instead of having to edit the existing URL.)
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Shortcuts are presented in all capital letters (ALL CAPS); however, the search box is case-insensitive. For example, in the search box, you can type wp:r, instead of WP:R. However, when using the URL method (or when making links) it is necessary to match the capitalization of the shortcut itself.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Shortcuts are often used on talk pages in their abbreviated form, decreasing readability for the general reader. For example, some editors are familiar with the bulk of the Wikipedia namespace shortcuts, recognizing what they stand for on sight. Others, however, are faced with pages full of incomprehensible jargon, the meaning of which is not immediately clear. Shortcuts also are sometimes (ab)used to make a WP:POINT, best described by WP:WOTTA.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"To avoid these problems, a good practice when creating shortcuts is to choose common English words that are easily identifiable and memorable. Another good practice is to be mindful of the general reader and use meaningful terms when citing an obscure shortcut. For example, the piped link [[WP:SHC|shortcut]] gives readers an idea of the subject of the target page, while the bare abbreviation [[WP:SHC]] is unintelligible to those unfamiliar with the term.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"It should also be remembered that shortcuts are a convenience, not a substitute for titles. Shortcuts should not appear in ""See also"" sections, hatnotes or any other place where a page title is expected.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Small link boxes, listing the names of the page's shortcuts, appear at the top of many pages, especially those on policies and guidelines. A shortcut link box can be added to a page, by placing the template {{shortcut|WP:<x>}} (for project namespace) or {{shortcut|H:<x>}} (for Help pages) at the top of the page's text, while editing.  
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"The point of these template boxes is not to list every single redirect for any given page (indeed, that's what Special:WhatLinksHere is for); instead, they generally should list only the most common and easily remembered redirects.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Guideline pages with shortcuts pointing to them typically use {{guideline|WP:<x>}} or the {{subcat guideline}} template, such as on this page, instead of the shortcut template {{shortcut}}. Another frequently used template is: {{MoS-guideline|MOS:<x>}}.

"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Shortcuts that do not follow the above naming convention are discouraged, and are typically deleted.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"The directory of shortcuts contains several conflicts for prefixes of subpages, often caused by a shortcut being 're-targeted' (modified to point to a new target page) without the shortcuts to subpages also being re-targeted.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Before creating a shortcut, use Special:PrefixIndex to ensure that the same prefix is not being used for different purposes.  e.g. WP:CJ has several existing uses.  No additional confusion would be caused by creating a shortcut WP:CJQ, however creating a shortcut WP:CJ/Q would be adding to the existing mess.  There is a long-standing feature request to resolve shortcut subpages automatically. (See T14980.)

"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"When the shortcut does not use one of the namespace aliases listed above (WP or WT), it is a cross-namespace redirect and is case-sensitive.
"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"However, when a prefix is used by multiple shortcuts, and has broad community support, it is referred to as a pseudo-namespace to distinguish these shortcuts from other cross-namespace redirects.

"
Wikipedia:Shortcut - Wikipedia,"Technical note: The links in the table go to a page where the term prefix is not used in the meaning as it has in this section.

All it takes is to click on the shortcut wherever it is, then on the page it leads to (a shortcut is a redirect) click on the ""redirected from"" link near the top of the page (forcing &redirect=no in the URL when you go back to the shortcut page); edit the target #REDIRECT [[Wikipedia:Whatever]]; then add {{R from shortcut}} if that template doesn't already appear.

"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Categories are intended to group together pages on similar subjects. They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like [[Category:XYZ]] in its wikimarkup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ. Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page. Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles (or other pages) that have been added to that particular category. There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category. The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"The term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the category pagename—and the category itself. Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques. (See also the search box parameter ""incategory"".) The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"The MediaWiki software maintains tables of categories, to which any editable page can be added. To add a page to a category, include ""[[Category:Category name]]"" or ""[[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]"" in that page's wikimarkup. The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"A category is usually associated with a category page in the ""Category:"" namespace.[1] A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links. Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"A category page is any page in the Category namespace.  They each act as a category, and are termed a ""category"".  The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other ""categories"", and one section titled Pages, listing pages as categorized (in other namespaces). New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"A category page can be edited like any other page. However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows:
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"The items in the lists all link to the pages concerned; in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it (the name of the image).
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"For the way in which the lists are ordered, see Sorting category pages below. The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key. These initial characters are displayed above the sections. To suppress these, make all sort keys start with a space.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"A category page can only display a limited number of items (currently 200). If more pages belong to the category, there will be a link to the next ones.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia," The categories box for the category page appears at the bottom, in the same place as for other pages. This contains the categories to which the current category page has been added, i.e. its parent categories (the categories of which it is a subcategory). Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the ""[[Category:Category name]]"" or ""[[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]"" syntax.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"A page belongs to a category if the page's wikimarkup contains a declaration for that category. A category declaration takes the form [[Category:Category name]] or [[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]. The declaration must be processed, i.e. it will not work if it appears between <nowiki>...</nowiki> or <includeonly>...</includeonly> tags, or in a comment. The declaration may however come from a transcluded page; see Categories and templates below.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"A category name can be any string that would be a legitimate page title. If the category name begins with a lower-case letter it will be capitalized.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"In Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wikimarkup, but before any stub templates (which themselves transclude categories) and interlanguage links.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"When a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page (or possibly elsewhere, if a non-default skin is being used). This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wikimarkup. The category names are linked to the corresponding category pages. They appear as redlinks if the corresponding category page does not exist. If a user has enabled the HotCat gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole page.

"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"By default, a page is sorted under the first character of its name, without the namespace. English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with À, Á, Ä, will be listed under heading A. Sorting is case-insensitive, so ""ABC"" comes after ""Abacus"".
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Unlike at Special:Allpages and Special:Prefixindex, a space is treated as a space (coming before all other characters), not as an underscore.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"The English Wikipedia has numerical sorting in categories. This means a page whose title begins with a number will be sorted according to the numeric value of the number (even if it is multiple digits). Thus ""9 dogs"", ""25 dogs"", and ""112 dogs"" will all appear under the ""0–9"" heading in numeric order. If the number includes a comma, space, or period, the sorting algorithm will only consider the part of the number before the separator.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Each of the three lists (subcategories, pages, media files) is arranged in the order explained above (except that, in the subcategories list, the namespace indicator ""Category:"" is not considered). If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name (sort key) for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list:

"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside <includeonly></includeonly> tags on the template (e.g. <includeonly>[[Category:category name]]</includeonly>).

This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories.
"
Help:Category - Wikipedia,"Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page.  When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved.  When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list.

To add the template to a category without categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, or add it to the template documentation page between <includeonly></includeonly> (the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch it).

Wikipedia:Portal/Guidelines - Wikipedia,"A portal helps to browse on a particular subject, hence the subject of a portal should be broad so that it presents a diversified content. The portal subject area should have enough interest and articles to sustain a portal, including enough quality content articles above a Start-class to sustain the featured content section. To aid in this, the portal should be associated with a WikiProject (or have editors with sufficient interest)[1] to help ensure a supply of new material for the portal and maintain the portal. 
"
Wikipedia:Portal/Guidelines - Wikipedia,"The portal layout should be complete or there should be ongoing efforts to make the portal layout complete.  The portal should be maintained and serve a useful purpose.

Alice non lo sa - Wikipedia,"Alice non lo sa is the debut solo album by Italian singer-songwriter Francesco De Gregori, released on April 1973 by It. The previous year the eponymous duo of De Gregori and Antonello Venditti—another Italian singer-songwriter–published a hybrid album, Theorius Campus, with some songs by De Gregori.[2]

Alice non lo sa - Wikipedia,"The historian Cesare Grazioli writes that De Gregori became the acknowledged ""prince"" of songwriters, inspired by Bob Dylan, a melancholy narrative voice expressing the doubt, ambiguity and human crisis of the times, with Alice no lo sa his first album.[6] The album gained for De Gregori an undeserved reputation for being obscure.[7] The album indicated De Gregori's innovativeness: the title song, ""Alice"", broke with the past with its elegant lyrics and visionary quality,[8] still esteemed a generation later.[9] The album was not an immediate commercial hit, but it had great artistic value with its evocative poetry and sophisticated melodies, and it proved to be the first of a series of masterpieces of popular music.[10] Mariano Prunes, reviewing the album on AllMusic.com, notes that while only the title track is recognised as a classic, several other songs deserve to be. The album, writes Prunes, is influenced by Leonard Cohen, and ""Marianna al Bivio"" actually refers to Cohen's songs ""Suzanne"" and ""So Long, Marianne"", the lyrics throughout taking centre stage rather than, as was de rigueur in Italy at the time, making the singing openly personal or political.[11]

Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"In animal husbandry, feed conversion ratio (FCR) or feed conversion rate is a ratio or rate measuring of the efficiency with which the bodies of livestock convert animal feed into the desired output. For dairy cows, for example, the output is milk, whereas in animals raised for meat (such as beef cows,[1] pigs, chickens, and fish) the output is the flesh, that is, the body mass gained by the animal, represented either in the final mass of the animal or the mass of the dressed output.  FCR is the mass of the input divided by the output (thus mass of feed per mass of milk or meat). In some sectors, feed efficiency, which is the output divided by the input (i.e. the inverse of FCR), is used. These concepts are also closely related to efficiency of conversion of ingested foods (ECI).
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"Feed conversion ratio (FCR) is the ratio of inputs to outputs; it is the inverse of ""feed efficiency"" which is the ratio of outputs to inputs.[2] FCR is widely used in hog and poultry production, while FE is used more commonly with cattle.[2]  Being a ratio the FCR is dimensionless, that is, it is not affected by the units of measurement used to determine the FCR.[3]
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"FCR a function of the animal's genetics[4] and age,[5] the quality and ingredients of the feed,[5] and the conditions in which the animal is kept,[1][6] and storage and use of the feed by the farmworkers.[7]
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"As a rule of thumb, the daily FCR is low for young animals (when relative growth is large) and increases for older animals (when relative growth tends to level out).   However FCR is a poor basis to use for selecting animals to improve genetics, as that results in larger animals that cost more to feed; instead residual feed intake (RFI) is used which is independent of size.[8]  RFI uses for output the difference between actual intake and predicted intake based on an animal's body weight, weight gain, and composition.[8][9]
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"The outputs portion may be calculated based on weight gained, on the whole animal at sale, or on the dressed product; with milk it may be normalized for fat and protein content.[10]
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"As for the inputs portion, although FCR is commonly calculated using feed dry mass, it is sometimes calculated on an as-fed wet mass basis, (or in the case of grains and oilseeds, sometimes on a wet mass basis at standard moisture content), with feed moisture resulting in higher ratios.[11]
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"Animals that have a low FCR are considered efficient users of feed. However, comparisons of FCR among different species may be of little significance unless the feeds involved are of similar quality and suitability.
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"As of 2013[update] in the US, an FCR calculated on live weight gain of 4.5–7.5 was in the normal range with an FCR above 6 being typical.[8] Divided by an average carcass yield of 62.2%, the typical carcass weight FCR is above 10. As of 2013[update] FCRs had not changed much compared to other fields in the prior 30 years, especially compared to poultry which had improved feed efficiency by about 250% since the late 1800s.[8]
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"The dairy industry traditionally didn't use FCR but in response to increasing concentration in the dairy industry and other livestock operations, the EPA updated its regulations in 2003 controlling manure and other waste releases produced by livestock operators.[12]:11–11  In response the USDA began issuing guidance to dairy farmers about how to control inputs to better minimize manure output and to minimize harmful contents, as well as optimizing milk output.[13][14]
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"In the US, the price of milk is based on the protein and fat content, so the FCR is often calculated to take that into account.[15]  Using an FCR calculated just on the weight of protein and fat, as of 2011[update] an FCR of 13 was poor, and an FCR of 8 was very good.[15]
"
Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"Another method for dealing with pricing based on protein and fat, is using energy-corrected milk (ECM), which adds a factor to normalize assuming certain amounts of fat and protein in a final milk product; that formula is (0.327 x milk mass) + (12.95 x fat mass) + (7.2 x protein mass).[11]

Feed conversion ratio - Wikipedia,"The FIFO ratio (or Fish In – Fish Out ratio) is a conversion ratio applied to aquaculture, where the first number is the mass of harvested fish used to feed farmed fish, and the second number is the mass of the resulting farmed fish.[27][28]  FIFO is a way of expressing the contribution from harvested wild fish used in aquafeed compared with the amount of edible farmed fish, as a ratio.  Fishmeal and fish oil inclusion rates in aquafeeds have shown a continual decline over time as aquaculture grows and more feed is produced, but with a finite annual supply of fishmeal and fish oil.  Calculations have shown that the overall fed aquaculture FIFO declined from 0.63 in 2000 to 0.33 in 2010, and 0.22 in 2015.[29]  In 2015, therefore, approximately 4.55 kg of farmed fish was produced for every 1 kg of wild fish harvested and used in feed.  The fish used in fishmeal and fish oil production are not used for human consumption, but with their use as fishmeal and fish oil in aquafeed they contribute to global food production.

Camel - Wikipedia,"A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as ""humps"" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"The word camel is also used informally in a wider sense, where the more correct term is ""camelid"", to include all seven species of the family Camelidae: the true camels (the above three species), along with the ""New World"" camelids: the llama, the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicuña.[7] The word itself is derived via Latin: camelus and Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from Hebrew, Arabic or Phoenician: gāmāl.[8][9]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"3 species are extant:[10][11]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"The average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years.[12] A full-grown adult dromedary camel stands 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) at the shoulder and 2.15 m (7 ft 1 in) at the hump.[13] Bactrian camels can be a foot taller. Camels can run at up to 65 km/h (40 mph) in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h (25 mph).[14] Bactrian camels weigh 300 to 1,000 kg (660 to 2,200 lb) and dromedaries 300 to 600 kg (660 to 1,320 lb). The widening toes on a camel's hoof provide supplemental grip for varying soil sediments.[15]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"The male dromedary camel has an organ called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth.[16] Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind.[17] The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session.[18] Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.[19]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"Camels do not directly store water in their humps; they are reservoirs of fatty tissue. When this tissue is metabolized, it yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed. This fat metabolization, while releasing energy, causes water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration (as oxygen is required for the metabolic process): overall, there is a net decrease in water.[20][21]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"Camels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water.[23]  The dromedary camel can drink as seldom as once every 10 days even under very hot conditions, and can lose up to 30% of its body mass due to dehydration.[24] Unlike other mammals, camels' red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape. This facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration[25] and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water: a 600 kg (1,300 lb) camel can drink 200 L (53 US gal) of water in three minutes.[26][27]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"Camels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other mammals. Their temperature ranges from 34 °C (93 °F) at dawn and steadily increases to 40 °C (104 °F) by sunset, before they cool off at night again.[23] In general, to compare between camels and the other livestock, camels lose only 1.3 liters of fluid intake every day while the other livestock lose 20 to 40 liters per day (Breulmann, et al., 2007).[28] Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals; to assist this, camels have a rete mirabile, a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain.[29] Camels rarely sweat, even when ambient temperatures reach 49 °C (120 °F).[30] Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat; the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat. Camels can withstand losing 25% of their body weight to sweating, whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 12–14% dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbance.[27]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"When the camel exhales, water vapor becomes trapped in their nostrils and is reabsorbed into the body as a means to conserve water.[31] Camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies' hydrated state without the need for drinking.[32]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"The camel's thick coat insulates it from the intense heat radiated from desert sand; a shorn camel must sweat 50% more to avoid overheating.[33] During the summer the coat becomes lighter in color, reflecting light as well as helping avoid sunburn.[27] The camel's long legs help by keeping its body farther from the ground, which can heat up to 70 °C (158 °F).[34][35] Dromedaries have a pad of thick tissue over the sternum called the pedestal. When the animal lies down in a sternal recumbent position, the pedestal raises the body from the hot surface and allows cooling air to pass under the body.[29]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"Camels' mouths have a thick leathery lining, allowing them to chew thorny desert plants. Long eyelashes and ear hairs, together with nostrils that can close, form a barrier against sand. If sand gets lodged in their eyes, they can dislodge it using their transparent third eyelid. The camels' gait and widened feet help them move without sinking into the sand.[34][36][37]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"The kidneys and intestines of a camel are very efficient at reabsorbing water. Camels' kidneys have a 1:4 cortex to medulla ratio.[38] Thus, the medullary part of a camel's kidney occupies twice as much area as a cow's kidney. Secondly, renal corpuscles have a smaller diameter, which reduces surface area for filtration. These two major anatomical characteristics enable camels to conserve water and limit the volume of urine in extreme desert conditions.[39] Camel urine comes out as a thick syrup, and camel faeces are so dry that they do not require drying when the Bedouins use them to fuel fires.[40][41][42][43]
"
Camel - Wikipedia,"The camel immune system differs from those of other mammals. Normally, the Y-shaped antibody molecules consist of two heavy (or long) chains along the length of the Y, and two light (or short) chains at each tip of the Y. Camels, in addition to these, also have antibodies made of only two heavy chains, a trait that makes them smaller and more durable. These ""heavy-chain-only"" antibodies, discovered in 1993, are thought to have developed 50 million years ago, after camelids split from ruminants and pigs.[44]

Camel - Wikipedia,"The karyotypes of different camelid species have been studied earlier by many groups,[45][46][47][48][49][50] but no agreement on chromosome nomenclature of camelids has been reached. A 2007 study flow sorted camel chromosomes, building on the fact that camels have 37 pairs of chromosomes (2n=74), and found that the karyotype consisted of one metacentric, three submetacentric, and 32 acrocentric autosomes. The Y is a small metacentric chromosome, while the X is a large metacentric chromosome.[51]

The hybrid is 2.15 m (7 ft 1 in) at the shoulder and 2.32 m (7 ft 7 in) tall at the hump. It weighs an average of 650 kg (1,430 lb) and can carry around 400 to 450 kg (880 to 990 lb), which is more than either the dromedary or Bactrian can.[52]

Camel - Wikipedia,"According to molecular data, the wild Bactrian camel (C. ferus) separated from the domestic Bactrian camel (C. bactrianus) about 1 million years ago.[53][54] New World and Old World camelids diverged about 11 million years ago.[55] In spite of this, these species can hybridize and produce viable offspring.[56] The cama is a camel-llama hybrid bred by scientists to see how closely related the parent species are.[57] Scientists collected semen from a camel via an artificial vagina and inseminated a llama after stimulating ovulation with gonadotrophin injections.[58] The cama is halfway in size between a camel and a llama and lacks a hump. It has ears intermediate between those of camels and llamas, longer legs than the llama, and partially cloven hooves.[59][60] Like the mule, camas are sterile, despite both parents having the same number of chromosomes.[58]

The male dromedary carcass can weigh 300–400 kg (661–882 lb), while the carcass of a male Bactrian can weigh up to 650 kg (1,433 lb). The carcass of a female dromedary weighs less than the male, ranging between 250 and 350 kg (550 and 770 lb).[18] The brisket, ribs and loin are among the preferred parts, and the hump is considered a delicacy.[121] The hump contains ""white and sickly fat"", which can be used to make the khli (preserved meat) of mutton, beef, or camel.[122] On the other hand, camel milk and meat are rich in protein, vitamins, glycogen, and other nutrients making them essential in the diet of many people. From chemical composition to meat quality, the dromedary camel is the preferred breed for meat production. It does well even in arid areas due to its unusual physiological behaviors and characteristics, which include tolerance to extreme temperatures, radiation from the sun, water paucity, rugged landscape and low vegetation.[123] Camel meat is reported to taste like coarse beef, but older camels can prove to be very tough,[13][18] although camel meat becomes tenderer the more it is cooked.[124] The Abu Dhabi Officers' Club serves a camel burger mixed with beef or lamb fat in order to improve the texture and taste.[125] In Karachi, Pakistan, some restaurants prepare nihari from camel meat.[126] Specialist camel butchers provide expert cuts, with the hump considered the most popular.[127]

The other three toes are either present, absent, vestigial, or pointing posteriorly. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates bear weight on one (an odd number) of the five toes: the third toe.

The oldest fossils of even-toed ungulates date back to the early Eocene (about 53 million years ago). Since these findings almost simultaneously appeared in Europe, Asia, and North America, it is very difficult to accurately determine the origin of artiodactyls. The fossils are classified as belonging to the family Dichobunidae; their best-known and best-preserved member is Diacodexis.[1] These were small animals, some as small as a hare, with a slim build, lanky legs, and a long tail. Their hind legs were much longer than their front legs. The early to middle Eocene saw the emergence of the ancestors of most of today's mammals.[2]"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"Two formerly widespread, but now extinct, families of even-toed ungulates were Entelodontidae and Anthracotheriidae. Entelodonts existed from the middle Eocene to the early Miocene in Eurasia and North America. They had a stocky body with short legs and a massive head, which was characterized by two humps on the lower jaw bone. Anthracotheres had a large, porcine (pig-like) build, with short legs and an elongated muzzle. This group appeared in the middle Eocene up until the Pliocene, and spread throughout Eurasia, Africa, and North America. Anthracotheres are thought to be the ancestors of hippos, and, likewise, probably led a similar aquatic lifestyle. Hippopotamuses appeared in the late Miocene and occupied Africa and Asia—they never got to the Americas.[2]
"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"The camels (Tylopoda) were, during large parts of the Cenozoic, limited to North America; early forms like Cainotheriidae occupied Europe. Among the North American camels were groups like the stocky, short-legged Merycoidodontidae. They first appeared in the late Eocene and developed a great diversity of species in North America. Only in the late Miocene or early Pliocene did they migrate from North America into Eurasia. The North American varieties became extinct around 10,000 years ago.

With only the peccaries, lamoids (or llamas), and various species of capreoline deer, South America has comparatively fewer artiodactyl families than other continents, except Australia, which has no native species.
"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"The classification of artiodactyls was hotly debated because the ocean-dwelling cetaceans evolved from the land-dwelling even-toed ungulates. Some semiaquatic even-toed ungulates (hippopotamuses) are more closely related to the ocean-dwelling cetaceans than to the other even-toed ungulates.
"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"This makes the Artiodactyla as traditionally defined a paraphyletic taxon, since it includes animals descended from a common ancestor, but does not include all of its descendants. Phylogenetic classification only recognizes monophyletic taxa; that is, groups that descend from a common ancestor and include all of its descendants. To address this problem, the traditional order Artiodactyla and infraorder Cetacea are sometimes subsumed into the more inclusive Cetartiodactyla taxon.[3] An alternative approach is to include both land-dwelling even-toed ungulates and ocean-dwelling cetaceans in a revised Artiodactyla taxon.[2]
"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"In the 1990s, biological systematics used not only morphology and fossils to classify organisms, but also molecular biology. Molecular biology involves sequencing an organism's DNA and RNA and comparing the sequence with that of other living beings—the more similar they are, the more closely they are related. Comparison of even-toed ungulate and cetaceans genetic material has shown that the closest living relatives of whales and hippopotamuses is the paraphyletic group Artiodactyla.
"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"Dan Graur and Desmond Higgins were among the first to come to this conclusion, and included a paper published in 1994.[5] However, they did not recognize hippopotamuses and classified the ruminants as the sister group of cetaceans. Subsequent studies established the close relationship between hippopotamuses and cetaceans; these studies were based on casein genes,[6] SINEs,[7] fibrinogen sequences,[8] cytochrome and rRNA sequences,[3][9] IRBP (and vWF) gene sequences,[10] adrenergic receptors,[11] and apolipoproteins.[12]

In 2001, the fossil limbs of a Pakicetus (amphibioid cetacean the size of a wolf) and Ichthyolestes (an early whale the size of a fox) were found in Pakistan. They were both archaeocetes (""ancient whales"") from about 48 million years ago (in the Eocene). These findings showed that archaeocetes were more terrestrial than previously thought, and that the special construction of the talus (ankle bone) with a double-rolled joint surface,[clarification needed] previously thought to be unique to even-toed ungulates, were also in early cetaceans.[13] The mesonychids, another type of ungulate, did not show this special construction of the talus, and thus was concluded to not have the same ancestors as cetaceans."
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"The oldest cetaceans date back to the early Eocene (53 million years ago), whereas the oldest known hippopotamus dates back only to the Miocene (15 million years ago). Some doubts have arisen regarding the relationship between the two, as there is a 40-million-year gap between their first appearances in the fossil record. It seems unlikely that there were ancestral hippos that left no remains, given the high number of even-toed ungulate fossils. Some studies proposed the late emergence of hippos is because they are relatives of peccaries and split recently, but molecular findings contradict this. Research is therefore focused on anthracortheres (family Anthracotheriidae); one dating from the Eocene to Miocene was declared to be ""hippo-like"" upon discovery in the 19th century. A study from 2005 showed that the anthracotheres and hippopotamuses have very similar skulls, but differed in the adaptations of their teeth. It was nevertheless believed that cetaceans and anthracothereres descended from a common ancestor, and that hippopotamuses developed from anthracotheres. A study published in 2015 was able to confirm this, but also revealed that hippopotamuses were derived from older anthracotheriens.[9][14] The newly introduced genus Epirigenys from eastern Africa is thus the sister group of hippos.

Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"Internal morphology (mainly the stomach and the molars) were used for classification. Suines (including pigs) and hippopotamuses have molars with well-developed roots and a simple stomach that digests food. Thus, they were grouped together as non-ruminants (Porcine). All other even-toed ungulates have molars with a selenodont construction (crescent-shaped cusps) and have the ability to ruminate, which requires regurgitating food and re-chewing it. Differences in stomach construction indicated that rumination evolved independently between tylopods and ruminants; therefore, tylopods were excluded from Ruminantia.

Two major body types are known: Suinids and hippopotamuses are characterized by a stocky body, short legs, and a large head; camels and ruminants, though, have a more slender build and lanky legs. Size varies considerably; the smallest member, the mouse deer, often reaches a body length of only 45 centimeters (18 in) and a weight of 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb). The largest member, the hippopotamus, can grow up to 5 meters (16 ft) in length and weigh 4.5 metric tons (5 short tons), and the giraffe can grow to be 5.5 meters (18 ft) tall and 4.7 meters (15 ft) in body length. All even-toed ungulates display some form of sexual dimorphism: the males are consistently larger and heavier than the females. In deer, only the males boast antlers, and the horns of bovines are usually small or not present in females. Male Indian antelopes have a much darker coat than females.

In general, the claws of the forelegs are wider and blunter than those of the hind legs, and the gape is farther apart. Aside from camels, all even-toed ungulates put just the tip of the foremost phalanx on the ground.[25]
"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"In even-toed ungulates, the bones of the stylopodium (upper arm or thigh bone) and zygopodiums (tibia and fibula) are usually elongated. The muscles of the limbs are predominantly localized, which ensures that artiodactyls often have very slender legs. A clavicle is never present, and the scapula is very agile and swings back and forth for added mobility when running. The special construction of the legs causes the legs to be unable to rotate, which allows for greater stability when running at high speeds. In addition, many smaller artiodactyls have a very flexible body, contributing to their speed by increasing their stride length.

Ossicones are permanent bone structures that fuse to the frontal or parietal bones during an animal's life and are found only in the Giraffidae.

"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"The ruminants (Ruminantia and Tylopoda) ruminate their food—they regurgitate and re-chew it. Ruminants' mouths often have additional salivary glands, and the oral mucosa is often heavily calloused to avoid injury from hard plant parts and to allow easier transport of roughly chewed food. Their stomachs are divided into three to four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum.[28] After the food is ingested, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into layers of solid versus liquid material. The solids lump together to form a bolus (also known as the cud); this is regurgitated by reticular contractions while the glottis is closed. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and re-swallowed. The bolus is chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break it down. Ingested food passes to the ""fermentation chamber"" (rumen and reticulum), where it is kept in continual motion by rhythmic contractions. Cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose found in plant material.[28] This form of digestion has two advantages: plants that are indigestible to other species can be digested and used, and the duration of the actual food consumption shortened; the animal spends only a short time out in the open with his head to the ground—rumination can take place later, in a sheltered area.[29]
"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"Tylopoda (camels, llamas, and alpacas) and chevrotains have three-chambered stomachs, while the rest of Ruminantia have four-chambered stomachs. The handicap of a heavy digestive system has increased selective pressure towards limbs that allow the animal to quickly escape predators.[30] Most species within Suina have a simple two-chambered stomach that allows an omnivorous diet. The babirusa, however, is an herbivore,[28] and has extra maxillary teeth to allow for proper mastication of plant material. Most of the fermentation occurs with the help of cellulolytic microorganisms within the caecum of the large intestine. Peccaries have a complex stomach that contains four compartments.[29] Their fore stomach has fermentation carried out by microbes and has high levels of volatile fatty acid; it has been proposed that their complex fore stomach is a means to slow digestive passage and increase digestive efficiency.[29] Hippopotamuses have three-chambered stomachs and do not ruminate. They consume around 68 kilograms (150 lb) of grass and other plant matter each night. They may cover distances up to 32 kilometers (20 mi) to obtain food, which they digest with the help of microbes that produce cellulase. Their closest living relatives, the whales, are obligate carnivores.

Some artiodactyls also benefit from the fact that their predators (e.g. the Tasmanian tiger) were severely decimated by ranchers, who saw them as competition.[36]
"
Even-toed ungulate - Wikipedia,"Conversely, many artiodactyls have declined significantly in numbers, and some have even gone extinct, largely due to over-hunting, and, more recently, habitat destruction. Extinct species include several gazelles, the aurochs, the Malagasy hippopotamus, the bluebuck, and Schomburgk's deer. Two species, the Scimitar-horned oryx and Père David's deer, are extinct in the wild. Fourteen species are considered critically endangered, including the addax, the kouprey, the Bactrian camel, Przewalski's gazelle, the saiga, and the pygmy hog. Twenty-four species are considered endangered.[40][41]

Paywall - Wikipedia,"
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"A paywall is a method of restricting access to content, especially news, via a purchase or a paid subscription.[1][2] Beginning in the mid-2010s, newspapers started implementing paywalls on their websites as a way to increase revenue after years of decline in paid print readership and advertising revenue, partly due to the use of ad blockers.[3] In academics, research papers are often subject to a paywall and are available via academic libraries that subscribe.[4][5]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Paywalls have also been used as a way of increasing the number of print subscribers; for example, some newspapers offer access to online content plus delivery of a Sunday print edition at a lower price than online access alone.[6] Newspaper websites such as that of The Boston Globe and The New York Times use this tactic because it increases both their online revenue and their print circulation (which in turn provides more ad revenue).[6]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"In 1996, The Wall Street Journal set up and has continued to maintain a ""hard"" paywall.[7] It continued to be widely read, acquiring over one million users by mid-2007,[8] and 15 million visitors in March 2008.[9]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"In 2010, following in the footsteps of The Wall Street Journal, The Times (London) implemented a ""hard"" paywall; a decision which was controversial because, unlike The Wall Street Journal, The Times is a general news site, and it was said that rather than paying, users would seek the information without charge elsewhere.[10] The paywall was deemed in practice to be neither a success nor a failure, having recruited 105,000 paying visitors.[11] In contrast The Guardian resisted the use of a paywall, citing ""a belief in an open Internet"" and ""care in the community"" as its reasoning – an explanation found in its welcome article to online news readers who, blocked from The Times site following the implementation of their paywall, came to The Guardian for online news.[12] The Guardian since experimented with other revenue-increasing ventures such as open API. Other papers, prominently The New York Times, have oscillated between the implementation and removal of various paywalls.[13] Because online news remains a relatively new medium, it has been suggested that experimentation is key to maintaining revenue while keeping online news consumers satisfied.[14]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Some implementations of paywalls proved unsuccessful, and have been removed.[15] Experts who are skeptical of the paywall model include Arianna Huffington, who declared ""the paywall is history"" in a 2009 article in The Guardian.[16] In 2010, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales reportedly called The Times's paywall ""a foolish experiment.""[17] One major concern was that, with content so widely available, potential subscribers would turn to free sources for their news.[18] The adverse effects of earlier implementations included decline in traffic[19] and poor search engine optimization.[15]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Paywalls have become controversial, with partisans arguing over the effectiveness of paywalls in generating revenue and their effect on media in general.  Critics of paywalls include many businesspeople, academics such as media professor Jay Rosen, and journalists such as Howard Owens and media analyst Matthew Ingram of GigaOm.  Those who see potential in paywalls include investor Warren Buffett, former  Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.  Some have changed their opinions of paywalls.  Felix Salmon of Reuters was initially an outspoken skeptic of paywalls, but later expressed the opinion that they could be effective.[20] A NYU media theorist, Clay Shirky, was initially a skeptic of paywalls, but in May 2012 wrote, ""[Newspapers] should turn to their most loyal readers for income, via a digital subscription service of the sort the [New York Times] has implemented.""[21][22] Paywalls are rapidly changing journalism, with an impact on its practice and business model, and on freedom of information on the Internet, that is yet unclear.
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Three high level models of paywall have emerged: hard paywalls that allow no free content and prompt the user straight away to pay in order to read, listen or watch the content, soft paywalls that allow some free content, such as an abstract or summary, and metered paywalls that allow a set number of free articles that a reader can access over a specific period of time, allowing more flexibility in what users can view without subscribing.[23]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"The ""hard"" paywall, as used by The Times, requires paid subscription before any of their online content can be accessed. A paywall of this design is considered the riskiest option for the content provider.[24] It is estimated that a website will lose 90% of its online audience and ad revenue only to gain it back through its ability to produce online content appealing enough to attract subscribers.[24] News sites with ""hard"" paywalls can succeed if they:
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Many experts denounce the ""hard"" paywall because of its inflexibility, believing it acts as a major deterrent for users. Financial blogger Felix Salmon wrote that when one encounters a ""paywall and can’t get past it, you simply go away and feel disappointed in your experience.""[25] Jimmy Wales, founder of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, argued that the use of a ""hard"" paywall diminishes a site's influence. Wales stated that, by implementing a ""hard"" paywall, The Times ""made itself irrelevant.""[17] Though the Times had potentially increased its revenue, it decreased its traffic by 60%.[10]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"The ""soft"" paywall is best embodied by the metered model. The metered paywall allows users to view a specific number of articles before requiring paid subscription.[24] In contrast to sites allowing access to select content outside the paywall, the metered paywall allows access to any article as long as the user has not surpassed the set limit. The Financial Times allows users to access 10 articles before becoming paid subscribers.[24] The New York Times controversially[3] implemented a metered paywall in March 2011 which let users view 20 free articles a month before paid subscription. In April 2012 New York Times reduced the number of free articles per month to 10.[26] Their metered paywall has been defined as not only soft, but ""porous,""[25] because it also allows access to any link posted on a social media site, and up to 25 free articles a day if accessed through a search engine.[27] The model is designed to allow the paper to ""retain traffic from light users"", which in turn allows the paper to keep their number of visitors high, while receiving circulation revenue from the site's heavy users.[28] Using this model The New York Times garnered 224,000 subscribers in the first three months.[3] While many proclaimed The New York Times' paywall a success after it reported a profit in the third quarter of 2011, the profit increase is said to be ""ephemeral"" and ""largely based on a combination of cutbacks and the sale of assets.""[29] Though the success of a metered paywall would create revenue for the newspaper and increased freedom for the public, the profitability of the metered model has yet to be sufficiently proven.
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"A ""softer"" paywall strategy includes allowing free access to select content, while keeping premium content behind a paywall. Such a strategy has been said to lead to ""the creation of two categories: cheap fodder available for free (often created by junior staffers), and more 'noble' content.""[24] This type of separation brings into question the egalitarianism of the online news medium. According to political and media theorist Robert A Hackett, ""the commercial press of the 1800s, the modern world’s first mass medium, was born with a profound democratic promise: to present information without fear or favour, to make it accessible to everyone, and to foster public rationality based on equal access to relevant facts."".[30]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"The Boston Globe implemented a version of this strategy in September 2011 by launching a second website, BostonGlobe.com, to solely offer content from the paper behind a hard paywall, aside from most sports content, which was kept open to compete against other local sports websites. BostonGlobe.com operates alongside a second, pre-existing news website Boston.com, which now only contains a limited amount of content from the subscription website on a delay, but carries a larger focus on community-oriented news. The Boston Globe editor Martin Baron described them as ""two different sites for two different kinds of reader – some understand [that] journalism needs to be funded and paid for. Other people just won't pay. We have a site for them.""[31] By March 2014 the site had over 60,000 digital subscribers; at that time, the Globe announced that it would replace the hard paywall with a metered system allowing users to read 10 articles without charge in any 30-day period. The Boston Globe editor Brian McGrory believed that an ability to sample the site's premium content would encourage more people to subscribe to the service. At the same time, McGrory also announced plans to give Boston.com a more distinct editorial focus, with a ""sharper voice that better captures the sensibilities of Boston"", while migrating other content by Globe writers, such as blogs from Boston.com to the paper's website, but keeping them freely available.[32]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Professional reception to the implementation of paywalls has been mixed. Most discussion of paywalls centers on their success or failure as business ventures, and overlooks their ethical implications for maintaining an informed public. In the paywall debate there are those who see the implementation of a paywall as a ""sandbag strategy"" – a strategy which may help increase revenue in the short term, but not a strategy that will foster future growth for the newspaper industry.[33] For the ""hard"" paywall specifically, however, there seems to be an industry consensus that the negative effects (loss of readership) outweigh the potential revenue, unless the newspaper targets a niche audience.[24][34]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"There are also those who remain optimistic about the use of paywalls to help revitalize floundering newspaper revenues. Those who believe implementing paywalls will succeed, however, continually buffer their opinion with contingencies. Bill Mitchell states that for a paywall to bring new revenue and not deter current readers, newspapers must: ""invest in flexible systems, exploit their journalists' expertise in niche areas, and, crucially, offer readers their money's worth in terms of new value.""[14] The State of the News Media's 2011 annual report on American journalism makes the sweeping claim that: ""[t]o survive financially, the consensus on the business side of news operations is that news sites not only need to make their advertising smarter, but they also need to find some way to charge for content and to invent new revenue streams other than display advertising and subscriptions.""[35] Even those who do not believe in the general success of paywalls recognize that, for a profitable future, newspapers must start generating more attractive content with added value, or investigate new sources of earning revenue.[33]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Proponents of the paywall believe that it may be crucial for smaller publications to stay afloat. They argue that since 90 percent of advertising revenues are concentrated in the top 50 publishers, smaller operations can't necessarily depend on the traditional ad-supported free content model the way that larger sites can.[36] Many paywall advocates also contend that people are more than willing to pay a small price for quality content.  In a March 2013 guest post for VentureBeat, Malcolm CasSelle of MediaPass stated his belief that monetization would become ""something of a self-fulfilling prophecy: people [will] pay for content, and that money goes back into making the overall content even better.""[37]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"In April 2013 the Newspaper Association of America released its industry revenue profile for 2012, which reported that circulation revenue grew by 5 percent for dailies, making it the first year of circulation growth in ten years.   Digital-only circulation revenue reportedly grew 275%; print and digital bundled circulation revenue grew 499%.  Along with the shift towards bundling print and online into combined access subscriptions, print-only circulation revenue declined 14%.  This news corroborates a growing belief that digital subscriptions will be the key to securing the long-term survival of newspapers.[38][39]

Paywall - Wikipedia,"In May 2019, research by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford showed that despite the controversies surrounding paywalls, these were on the rise across Europe and the United States. According to the study by Felix Simon and Lucas Graves, more than two-thirds of leading newspapers (69%) across the EU and US were operating some kind of online paywall as of 2019, a trend that has increased since 2017 according to the researchers, with the US seeing an increase from 60% to 76%.[40][41]

Paywall - Wikipedia,"General user response to the implementation of paywalls has been measured through a number of recent studies which analyze readers' online news-reading habits. A study completed by the Canadian Media Research Consortium entitled ""Canadian Consumers Unwilling to Pay for News Online"", directly identifies the Canadian response to paywalls. Surveying 1,700 Canadians, the study found that 92% of participants who read the news online would rather find a free alternative than pay for their preferred site (in comparison to 82% of Americans[42]), while 81% stated that they would absolutely not pay for their preferred online news site.[43] Based on the poor reception of paid content by the participants, the study concludes with a statement similar to those of the media experts, stating, with the exception of prominent papers such as The Wall Street Journal and The Times, that given the ""current public attitudes, most publishers had better start looking elsewhere for revenue solutions.""[34]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Hackett argues that a ""forum on the internet [...] can function as a specialized or smaller-scale public sphere.""[44] In the past, the internet has been an ideal location for the general public to gather and discuss relevant news issues[45] – an activity made accessible first through free access to online news content, and subsequently the ability to comment on the content, creating a forum. Erecting a paywall restricts the public's open communication with one another by restricting the ability to both read and share online news.
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"The obvious way in which a paywall restricts equal access to the online public sphere is through requiring payment, deterring those who do not want to pay, and barring those who cannot from joining the online discussion. The restriction of equal access was taken to a new extreme when the UK's The Independent in October 2011 placed a paywall on foreign readers only.[46] Online news media have the proven ability to create global connection beyond the typical reach of a public sphere. In Democratizing Global Media, Hackett and global communications theorist Yuezhi Zhao describe how a new ""wave of media democratization arises in the era of the internet which has facilitated transnational civil society networks of and for democratic communication.""[47] By placing a paywall on their international readers, The Independent hinders the growth and democratic quality of the public sphere created by the internet.
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"The use of paywalls has also received many complaints from online news readers regarding an online subscriptions' inability to be shared like a traditional printed paper.  While a printed paper can be shared among friends and family, the ethics behind sharing an online subscription are less clear because there is no physical object involved. The New York Times' ""ethicist"" columnist, Ariel Kaminer, addressing the question of sharing online subscription, states that ""sharing with your spouse or young child is one thing; sharing with friends or family who live elsewhere is another.""[48] The reader comments following Kaminer's response focus on the dichotomy between paying for a printed paper and paying for an online subscription.[48] A printed paper's ease of access meant that more individuals could read a single copy, and that everyone who read the paper had the ability to send a letter to the editor without the hassle of registering or paying for the subscription. As such, the use of a paywall closes off the communication in both the personal realm and online. This opinion is not just held by online news readers, but also by opinion writers. Jimmy Wales comments that he ""would rather write [an opinion piece] where it is going to be read"", declaring that ""putting opinion pieces behind paywalls [makes] no sense.""[17] Without easy access to both read and share insights and opinions, the online news platform loses an essential characteristic of democratic exchange.
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"The use of a paywall to bar individuals from accessing news content online without payment, brings up numerous ethical questions. According to Hackett, media are already ""failing to furnish citizens with ready access to relevant civic information.""[49] The implementation of paywalls on previously free news content heightens this failure through intentional withholding. Hackett cites ""general cultural and economic mechanisms, such as the commodification of information and the dependence of commercial media on advertising revenue"" as two of the greatest influences on media performance. According to Hackett, these cultural and economic mechanisms ""generate violations of the democratic norm of equality.""[50] Implementation of a paywall addresses and intimately ties the two mechanisms cited by Hackett, as the paywall commodifies news content to bring in revenue from both readers and from increased circulation of printed paper's ads. The result of these mechanisms, as stated by Hackett, is an impediment to ""equal access to relevant [news] facts.""[30]
The commodification of information–making news into a product that must be purchased–restricts the egalitarian founding principle of the newspaper. Editor's Weblog reporter Katherine Travers, addressing this issue in a post discussing the future of The Washington Post, asks, ""is digital subscription as permissible as charging a couple of dollars now and then for a paper copy?""[51] While subscription fees have long been attached to print newspapers, all other forms of news have traditionally been free.[52] The UK's Daily Mail argues that print revenue is unique because ""people pay for the convenience of print in recognition of the special cost of production and delivery of a tangible product and because they purchase it whole.""[52] Online news, in comparison has existed as a medium of free dissemination. Poynter digital media fellow Jeff Sonderman outlines the ethical tension created by a paywall. Sonderman explains that ""[t]he underlying tension is that newspapers act simultaneously as businesses and as servants of the public’s interest. As for-profit enterprises, they have the right (the duty, even) to make money for shareholders or private owners. But most also claim to have a social compact, in which they safeguard the entire public interest and help their entire community shape and understand its shared values.""[53] By implementing a paywall before experimenting with other revenue-increasing initiatives, a newspaper arguably puts profit before the public.
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"While there has been little coverage and discussion of the ethical implications of the paywall regarding newspapers' obligation to maintain a generally informed public, there are two prominent instances where companies have addressed the restriction of online news coverage. First is the removal of paywalls in the face of breaking news (news covering national or local emergencies). Second is Google's ""First Click Free"" application, which news providers can implement if they wish to make news stories of interest accessible to readers regardless of a paywall.
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Some newspapers have removed their paywall from blocking content covering emergencies. When Hurricane Irene hit the United States' east coast in late August 2011, The New York Times declared that all storm related coverage, accessed both online and through mobile devices, would be free to readers.[54] The New York Times‌' assistant managing editor, Jeff Roberts, discusses the paper's decision, stating: ""[w]e are aware of our obligations to our audience and to the public at large when there is a big story that directly impacts such a large portion of people.""[53] In his article discussing the removal of paywalls, Soderman commends The New York Times' action, stating that, while a publisher ""commits to a paywall as the best business strategy for his news company, there may be some stories or subjects which carry such importance and urgency that it is irresponsible to withhold them from nonsubscribers.""[53]
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"Given the overwhelming opinion that, regardless of paywall success, new revenue sources must be sought out for newspapers' financial success, it is important to highlight new business initiatives. According to Poynter media expert Bill Mitchell, in order for a paywall to generate sustainable revenue, newspapers must create ""new value""—higher quality, innovation, etc.—in their online content that merits payment which previously free content did not.[14] In addition to erecting paywalls, newspapers have been increasingly exploiting tablet and mobile news products, the profitability of which remains inconclusive.[55][56] Some newspapers have also embraced targeting niche audiences, such as the Daily Mail's Mail Online in the UK.[52] Another strategy, pioneered by The New York Times, involves creating new revenue by packaging old content in e-books and special feature offerings, to create an appealing product for readers. The draw of these packages is not just the topic but the authors and the breadth of coverage. According to reporter Mathew Ingram, newspapers can benefit from these special offerings in two ways, first by taking advantage of old content when new interest arises, such as an anniversary or an important event, and second, through the creation of packages of general interest. The New York Times, for example, has created packages, mainly ebooks, on baseball, golf and the digital revolution.[57]

Paywall - Wikipedia,"An open API (application programming interface) makes the online news site ""a platform for data and information that [the newspaper company] can generate value from in other ways.""[33] Opening their API makes a newspaper's data available to outside sources, allowing developers and other services to make use of a paper's content for a fee.[58] The Guardian, in keeping with its ""belief in an open internet"",[12] has been experimenting with the use of API.[33] The Guardian has created an ""open platform"" which works on a three level system:
"
Paywall - Wikipedia,"While an open API is regarded as a gamble just like a paywall, journalist Matthew Ingram ethically notes that the use of an open API aims at ""profiting from the open exchange of information and other aspects of an online-media world, while the [paywall] is an attempt to create the kind of artificial information scarcity that newspapers used to enjoy.""[33] An open API keeps news content free to the public while the newspaper makes a profit from the quality and usefulness of its data to other businesses. The open API strategy can be commended because it takes the pressure off of the news room to continually investigate and explore new means of revenue. Instead, the open API strategy relies on the interest and ideas of those outside the newsroom, to whom the site's content and data are attractive.[58]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Academic publishing is the subfield of publishing which distributes academic research and scholarship. Most academic work is published in academic journal article, book or thesis form. The part of academic written output that is not formally published but merely printed up or posted on the Internet is often called ""grey literature"". Most scientific and scholarly journals, and many academic and scholarly books, though not all, are based on some form of peer review or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication. Peer review quality and selectivity standards vary greatly from journal to journal, publisher to publisher, and field to field.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Most established academic disciplines have their own journals and other outlets for publication, although many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. There is also a tendency for existing journals to divide into specialized sections as the field itself becomes more specialized. Along with the variation in review and publication procedures, the kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions to knowledge or research differ greatly among fields and subfields. In the sciences, the desire for statistically significant results leads to publication bias.[1]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Academic publishing is undergoing major changes, as it makes the transition from the print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. An important trend, particularly with respect to journals in the sciences, is open access via the Internet. In open access publishing, a journal article is made available free for all on the web by the publisher at the time of publication. Both open and closed journals are sometimes funded by the author paying an article processing charge, thereby shifting some fees from the reader to the researcher or their funder.  Many open or closed journals fund their operations without such fees. The Internet has facilitated open access self-archiving, in which authors themselves make a copy of their published articles available free for all on the web.[2][3] Some important results[4] in mathematics have been published only on arXiv.[5][6]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The Journal des sçavans (later spelled Journal des savants), established by Denis de Sallo, was the earliest academic journal published in Europe. Its content included obituaries of famous men, church history, and legal reports.[7] The first issue appeared as a twelve-page quarto pamphlet[8] on Monday, 5 January 1665,[9] shortly before the first appearance of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, on 6 March 1665.[10]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as a monogram, reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both Isaac Newton and Leibniz used this approach. However, this method did not work well. Robert K. Merton, a sociologist, found that 92% of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72% in the 18th century, 59% by the latter half of the 19th century, and 33% by the first half of the 20th century.[11] The decline in contested claims for priority in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals, with estimates suggesting that around 50 million journal articles[12] have been published since the first appearance of the Philosophical Transactions. The Royal Society was steadfast in its not-yet-popular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Early scientific journals embraced several models: some were run by a single individual who exerted editorial control over the contents, often simply publishing extracts from colleagues' letters, while others employed a group decision making process, more closely aligned to modern peer review. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that peer review became the standard.[13]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In the 1960s and 1970s, commercial publishers began to selectively acquire ""top-quality"" journals that were previously published by nonprofit academic societies. When the commercial publishers raised the subscription prices significantly, they lost little of the market, due to the inelastic demand for these journals. Although there are over 2,000 publishers, five for-profit companies (Reed Elsevier, Springer Science+Business Media, Wiley-Blackwell, Taylor & Francis, and Sage) accounted for 50% of articles published in 2013.[14][15] (Since 2013, Springer Science+Business Media has undergone a merger to form an even bigger company named Springer Nature.) Available data indicate that these companies have profit margins of around 40% making it one of the most profitable industries,[16][17] especially compared to the smaller publishers, which likely operate with low margins.[18] These factors have contributed to the ""serials crisis"" – total expenditures on serials increased 7.6% per year from 1986 to 2005, yet the number of serials purchased increased an average of only 1.9% per year.[19]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Unlike most industries, in academic publishing the two most important inputs are provided ""virtually free of charge"".[18] These are the articles and the peer review process. Publishers argue that they add value to the publishing process through support to the peer review group, including stipends, as well as through typesetting, printing, and web publishing. Investment analysts, however, have been skeptical of the value added by for-profit publishers, as exemplified by a 2005 Deutsche Bank analysis which stated that ""we believe the publisher adds relatively little value to the publishing process... We are simply observing that if the process really were as complex, costly and value-added as the publishers protest that it is,  40% margins wouldn't be available.""[18][16]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"A crisis in academic publishing is ""widely perceived"";[20] the apparent crisis has to do with the combined pressure of budget cuts at universities and increased costs for journals (the serials crisis).[21] The university budget cuts have reduced library budgets and reduced subsidies to university-affiliated publishers. The humanities have been particularly affected by the pressure on university publishers, which are less able to publish monographs when libraries can not afford to purchase them. For example, the ARL found that in ""1986, libraries spent 44% of their budgets on books compared with 56% on journals; twelve years later, the ratio had skewed to 28% and 72%.""[20] Meanwhile, monographs are increasingly expected for tenure in the humanities. In 2002 the Modern Language Association expressed hope that electronic publishing would solve the issue.[20]

Data analysis with open source tools like Unpaywall Journals empowered library systems in reducing their subscription costs by 70 % with the cancellation of the big deal with publishers like Elsevier.[23]

"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In academic publishing, a paper is an academic work that is usually published in an academic journal. It contains original research results or reviews existing results. Such a paper, also called an article, will only be considered valid if it undergoes a process of peer review by one or more referees (who are academics in the same field) who check that the content of the paper is suitable for publication in the journal. A paper may undergo a series of reviews, revisions, and re-submissions before finally being accepted or rejected for publication. This process typically takes several months. Next, there is often a delay of many months (or in some fields, over a year) before an accepted manuscript appears.[27] This is particularly true for the most popular journals where the number of accepted articles often outnumbers the space for printing. Due to this, many academics self-archive a 'pre-print' copy of their paper for free download from their personal or institutional website.

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Some journals, particularly newer ones, are now published in electronic form only. Paper journals are now generally made available in electronic form as well, both to individual subscribers, and to libraries. Almost always these electronic versions are available to subscribers immediately upon publication of the paper version, or even before; sometimes they are also made available to non-subscribers, either immediately (by open access journals) or after an embargo of anywhere from two to twenty-four months or more, in order to protect against loss of subscriptions. Journals having this delayed availability are sometimes called delayed open access journals.

A secondary benefit of the process is an indirect guard against plagiarism since reviewers are usually familiar with the sources consulted by the author(s). The origins of routine peer review for submissions dates to 1752 when the Royal Society of London took over official responsibility for Philosophical Transactions. However, there were some earlier examples.[31]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The process of academic publishing, which begins when authors submit a manuscript to a publisher, is divided into two distinct phases: peer review and production.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The process of peer review is organized by the journal editor and is complete when the content of the article, together with any associated images or figures, are accepted for publication. The peer review process is increasingly managed online, through the use of proprietary systems, commercial software packages, or open source and free software. A manuscript undergoes one or more rounds of review; after each round, the author(s) of the article modify their submission in line with the reviewers' comments; this process is repeated until the editor is satisfied and the work is accepted.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The production process, controlled by a production editor or publisher, then takes an article through copy editing, typesetting, inclusion in a specific issue of a journal, and then printing and online publication. Academic copy editing seeks to ensure that an article conforms to the journal's house style, that all of the referencing and labelling is correct, and that the text is consistent and legible; often this work involves substantive editing and negotiating with the authors.[34] Because the work of academic copy editors can overlap with that of authors' editors,[35] editors employed by journal publishers often refer to themselves as “manuscript editors”.[34]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In much of the 20th century, such articles were photographed for printing into proceedings and journals, and this stage was known as camera-ready copy. With modern digital submission in formats such as PDF, this photographing step is no longer necessary, though the term is still sometimes used.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The author will review and correct proofs at one or more stages in the production process. The proof correction cycle has historically been labour-intensive as handwritten comments by authors and editors are manually transcribed by a proof reader onto a clean version of the proof. In the early 21st century, this process was streamlined by the introduction of e-annotations in Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, and other programs, but it still remained a time-consuming and error-prone process. The full automation of the proof correction cycles has only become possible with the onset of online collaborative writing platforms, such as Authorea, Google Docs, and various others, where a remote service oversees the copy-editing interactions of multiple authors and exposes them as explicit, actionable historic events.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Academic authors cite sources they have used, in order to support their assertions and arguments and to help readers find more information on the subject. It also gives credit to authors whose work they use and helps avoid plagiarism. The topic of dual publication (also known as self-plagiarism) has been addressed by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), as well as in the research literature itself.[36][37][38]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Each scholarly journal uses a specific format for citations (also known as references). Among the most common formats used in research papers are the APA, CMS, and MLA styles.

The Chicago Manual of Style (CMS) is used in business, communications, economics, and social sciences. The CMS style uses footnotes at the bottom of page to help readers locate the sources.

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Scientific, technical, and medical (STM) literature is a large industry which generated $23.5 billion in revenue; $9.4 billion of that was specifically from the publication of English-language scholarly journals.[39] Most scientific research is initially published in scientific journals and considered to be a primary source. Technical reports, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), round out the primary literature. Secondary sources in the sciences include articles in review journals (which provide a synthesis of research articles on a topic to highlight advances and new lines of research), and books for large projects, broad arguments, or compilations of articles. Tertiary sources might include encyclopedias and similar works intended for broad public consumption or academic libraries.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"A partial exception to scientific publication practices is in many fields of applied science, particularly that of U.S. computer science research. An equally prestigious site of publication within U.S. computer science are some academic conferences.[40] Reasons for this departure include a large number of such conferences, the quick pace of research progress, and computer science professional society support for the distribution and archiving of conference proceedings.[41]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Publishing in the social sciences is very different in different fields. Some fields, like economics, may have very ""hard"" or highly quantitative standards for publication, much like the natural sciences. Others, like anthropology or sociology, emphasize field work and reporting on first-hand observation as well as quantitative work. Some social science fields, such as public health or demography, have significant shared interests with professions like law and medicine, and scholars in these fields often also publish in professional magazines.[42]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Publishing in the humanities is in principle similar to publishing elsewhere in the academy; a range of journals, from general to extremely specialized, are available, and university presses issue many new humanities books every year.  The arrival of online publishing opportunities has radically transformed the economics of the field and the shape of the future is controversial.[43] Unlike science, where timeliness is critically important, humanities publications often take years to write and years more to publish. Unlike the sciences, research is most often an individual process and is seldom supported by large grants. Journals rarely make profits and are typically run by university departments.[44]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The following describes the situation in the United States. In many fields, such as literature and history, several published articles are typically required for a first tenure-track job, and a published or forthcoming book is now often required before tenure. Some critics complain that this de facto system has emerged without thought to its consequences; they claim that the predictable result is the publication of much shoddy work, as well as unreasonable demands on the already limited research time of young scholars. To make matters worse, the circulation of many humanities journals in the 1990s declined to almost untenable levels, as many libraries cancelled subscriptions, leaving fewer and fewer peer-reviewed outlets for publication; and many humanities professors' first books sell only a few hundred copies, which often does not pay for the cost of their printing. Some scholars have called for a publication subvention of a few thousand dollars to be associated with each graduate student fellowship or new tenure-track hire, in order to alleviate the financial pressure on journals.

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Under Open Access, the content can be freely accessed and reused by anyone in the world using an Internet connection.

The impact of the work available as Open Access is maximised because, quoting the Library of Trinity College Dublin:[45]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Open Access is often confused with specific funding models such as Article Processing Charge (APC) being paid by authors or their funders, sometimes misleadingly called ""open access model"". The reason this term is misleading is due to the existence of many other models, including funding sources listed in the original the Budapest Open Access Initiative Declaration: ""the foundations and governments that fund research, the universities and laboratories that employ researchers, endowments set up by discipline or institution, friends of the cause of open access, profits from the sale of add-ons to the basic texts, funds freed up by the demise or cancellation of journals charging traditional subscription or access fees, or even contributions from the researchers themselves"". For more recent open public discussion of open access funding models, see Flexible membership funding model for Open Access publishing with no author-facing charges.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Prestige journals using the APC model often charge several thousand dollars. Oxford University Press, with over 300 journals, has fees ranging from  £1000-£2500, with discounts of 50% to 100% to authors from developing countries.[46]  Wiley Blackwell has 700 journals available, and they charge different amounts for each journal.[47]  Springer, with over 2600 journals, charges US$3000 or EUR 2200 (excluding VAT).[48]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The online distribution of individual articles and academic journals then takes place without charge to readers and libraries. Most open access journals remove all the financial, technical, and legal barriers that limit access to academic materials to paying customers. The Public Library of Science and BioMed Central are prominent examples of this model.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Fee-based open access publishing has been criticized on quality grounds, as the desire to maximize publishing fees could cause some journals to relax the standard of peer review. Although, similar desire is also present in the subscription model, where publishers increase numbers or published articles in order to justify raising their fees. It may be criticized on financial grounds as well because the necessary publication or subscription fees have proven to be higher than originally expected. Open access advocates generally reply that because open access is as much based on peer reviewing as traditional publishing, the quality should be the same (recognizing that both traditional and open access journals have a range of quality). It has also been argued that good science done by academic institutions who cannot afford to pay for open access might not get published at all, but most open access journals permit the waiver of the fee for financial hardship or authors in underdeveloped countries. In any case, all authors have the option of self-archiving their articles in their institutional repositories or disciplinary repositories in order to make them open access, whether or not they publish them in a journal.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"If they publish in a Hybrid open access journal, authors or their funders pay a subscription journal a publication fee to make their individual article open access. The other articles in such hybrid journals are either made available after a delay or remain available only by subscription. Most traditional publishers (including Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford University Press, and Springer Science+Business Media) have already introduced such a hybrid option, and more are following. The fraction of the authors of a hybrid open access journal that makes use of its open access option can, however, be small. It also remains unclear whether this is practical in fields outside the sciences, where there is much less availability of outside funding. In 2006, several funding agencies, including the Wellcome Trust and several divisions of the Research Councils in the UK announced the availability of extra funding to their grantees for such open access journal publication fees.

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In May 2016, the Council for the European Union agreed that from 2020 all scientific publications as a result of publicly funded research must be freely available. It also must be able to optimally reuse research data. To achieve that, the data must be made accessible, unless there are well-founded reasons for not doing so, for example, intellectual property rights or security or privacy issues.[49][50]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In recent decades there has been a growth in academic publishing in developing countries as they become more advanced in science and technology. Although the large majority of scientific output and academic documents are produced in developed countries, the rate of growth in these countries has stabilized and is much smaller than the growth rate in some of the developing countries. The fastest scientific output growth rate over the last two decades has been in the Middle East and Asia with Iran leading with an 11-fold increase followed by the Republic of Korea, Turkey, Cyprus, China, and Oman.[51] In comparison, the only G8 countries in top 20 ranking with fastest performance improvement are, Italy which stands at tenth and Canada at 13th globally.[52][53]

However, the United States' output dropped 52.3 to 49.4 per cent of the world's total, and its portion of the top one percent dropped from 65.6 to 62.8 per cent.[54]

The report predicted that China would overtake the United States sometime before 2020, possibly as early as 2013. China's scientific impact, as measured by other scientists citing the published papers the next year, is smaller although also increasing.[55]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"There is increasing frustration amongst OA advocates, with what is perceived as resistance to change on the part of many of the established academic publishers. Publishers are often accused of capturing and monetising publicly-funded research, using free academic labour for peer review, and then selling the resulting publications back to academia at inflated profits.[56] Such frustrations sometimes spill over into hyperbole, of which ""publishers add no value"" is one of the most common examples.[57]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"However, scholarly publishing is not a simple process, and publishers do add value to scholarly communication as it is currently designed.[58] Kent Anderson maintains a list of things that journal publishers do which currently contains 102 items and has yet to be formally contested from anyone who challenges the value of publishers.[59] Many items on the list could be argued to be of value primarily to the publishers themselves, e.g. ""Make money and remain a constant in the system of scholarly output"". However, others provide direct value to researchers and research in steering the academic literature. This includes arbitrating disputes (e.g. over ethics, authorship), stewarding the scholarly record, copy-editing, proofreading, type-setting, styling of materials, linking the articles to open and accessible datasets, and (perhaps most importantly) arranging and managing scholarly peer review. The latter is a task that should not be underestimated as it effectively entails coercing busy people into giving their time to improve someone else's work and maintain the quality of the literature. Not to mention the standard management processes for large enterprises, including infrastructure, people, security, and marketing. All of these factors contribute in one way or another to maintaining the scholarly record.[57]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"It could be questioned though, whether these functions are actually necessary to the core aim of scholarly communication, namely, dissemination of research to researchers and other stakeholders such as policy makers, economic, biomedical and industrial practitioners as well as the general public. Above, for example, we question the necessity of the current infrastructure for peer review, and if a scholar-led crowdsourced alternative may be preferable. In addition, one of the biggest tensions in this space is associated with the question if for-profit companies (or the private sector) should be allowed to be in charge of the management and dissemination of academic output and execute their powers while serving, for the most part, their own interests. This is often considered alongside the value added by such companies, and therefore the two are closely linked as part of broader questions on appropriate expenditure of public funds, the role of commercial entities in the public sector, and issues around the privatisation of scholarly knowledge.[57]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Publishing could certainly be done at a lower cost than common at present. There are significant researcher-facing inefficiencies in the system including the common scenario of multiple rounds of rejection and resubmission to various venues as well as the fact that some publishers profit beyond reasonable scale.[60] What is missing most[57] from the current publishing market, is transparency about the nature and the quality of the services publishers offer. This would allow authors to make informed choices, rather than decisions based on indicators that are unrelated to research quality, such as the JIF.[57] All the above questions are being investigated and alternatives could be considered and explored. Yet, in the current system, publishers still play a role in managing processes of quality assurance, interlinking and findability of research. As the role of scholarly publishers within the knowledge communication industry continues to evolve, it is seen as necessary[57] that they can justify their operation based on the intrinsic value that they add,[61][62] and combat the perception that they add no value to the process.

Author editing - Wikipedia,"An authors' editor is a language professional who works ""with authors to make draft texts fit for purpose"".[1] He or she edits manuscripts that have been drafted by the author (or authors) but have not yet been submitted to a publisher for publication.[2] This type of editing is called author editing, to distinguish it from other types of editing done for publishers on documents already accepted for publication: an authors' editor works ""with (and, commonly, for) an author rather than for a publisher"".[3] A term sometimes used synonymously with authors' editor is ""manuscript editor"" which, however, is less precise as it also refers to editors employed by scholarly journals to edit manuscripts after acceptance (in place of the term copy editor).[4]
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"Authors' editors usually work with academic authors, researchers and scientists writing scholarly journal articles, books and grant proposals.[5] Thus, the authors' editor facilitates the academic writing process by acting before submission or peer review. Authors' editors may also help authors revise manuscripts after peer review, but once the document is accepted for publication the collaboration ends (and other editors, for example a copy editor or production editor, take over).
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"An author's collaboration with an authors' editor begins after a manuscript has been drafted. The manuscript must be drafted in the desired publishing language: author editing does not include translation. The manuscript must be relatively complete, as author editing does not include the tasks of drafting or writing. If authors need help conceiving, structuring or writing their text, then they require the work of a developmental editor or a writer (e.g. medical writer or technical writer).
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"The goal of author editing is to help authors produce a clear, accurate and effective document that meets readers' expectations and that will be favorably received by publishers, journal editors and peer reviewers.[1][3] Therefore, authors' editors do both linguistic editing and substantive editing (editing of ""substance"", i.e. content[6]). They improve format, structure, grammar, style, data presentation, argumentation, flow and accuracy. They query authors about unclear content, inform and educate authors about good writing techniques (called ""didactic editing""[7]), and engage authors in revising the text (they ""elicit revision""[8]). Rather than simply correct the text, they collaborate with authors by dialoging with them (through in-text comments, email, phone, internet telephony, etc.) about the content and style; examples of how they annotate texts and negotiate the acceptability of the language have been given in an essay by Burrough-Boenisch.[3] Authors' editors may also advise authors on peer review and the publishing process,[1][2] and on high-impact publishing strategies.[9]
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"When authors receive the revised manuscript, they usually must dedicate substantial time and effort to reviewing the editor's changes and queries.[1] They may discuss the work with the editor, to learn why certain changes were made and to resolve issues that were raised during editing. After they have revised the text, they may resubmit it to the editor for an additional round of editing (if the fee agreement so permits) or finalize it on their own.
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"The authors' editor is an optional figure in the publishing process. Authors are more likely to hire an authors' editor when they are not fluent in the language in which they wish to publish: this is particularly the case for non-anglophone academics and scientists who publish their research in English for international communication. Another reason for working with an authors' editor regards the author's writing skills, as some scientists and clinicians may face difficulties composing an adequate text in a reasonable amount of time despite being excellent researchers.
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"Skilled writers will not need to hire such an editor, instead finding sufficient the feedback of colleagues (prior to submitting a manuscript) and peer reviewers (after submission). Nonetheless, even skilled writers may benefit from author editing, especially when they are short of time and have ambitious publishing goals. In fact, since these editors can save researchers time, help them improve their writing, and maximize their chances of publication success, when a regular collaboration is established, authors' editors can become trusted allies of research teams.[10]
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"Less skilled writers who are aware that editing will improve their manuscripts (or have been told to seek editing by a journal or publisher) also may not go to an authors' editor, but instead may use one of the many specialized editing firms (for convenience, greater availability, possibly lower costs). However, these firms, for their global nature, do not always permit the establishment of the collaborative relationship between editor and author-clients which is necessary for true author editing. Finally, novice writers may not realize how they can benefit by presubmission author editing; by submitting unedited manuscripts, they may find themselves in a situation of multiple rejections.[11]
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"Although the term ""authors' editor"" is little known, even by persons whose work could accurately be called author editing, it is not new but has been in use at least since the 1970s.[12] The roots of this profession seem to lie in the arena of medical editing in the United States. The first known use of the term to describe an editor working in the research setting dates to 1968, in an essay by Mayo Clinic editor Bernard Forscher.[13] In 1973, an article entitled ""The author's editor"" by L.B. Applewhite[14] was published in the first volume of the journal Medical Communications of the American Medical Writers Association.  In 1974, an essay by Barbara G. Cox with the same title[15] was published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings. In the early 1980s, the Council of Biology Editors (now the Council of Science Editors) began to define and discuss the role of authors' editors, through a seminal paper by Martha M. Tacker[16] followed by a national survey of 100 scientific authors' editors,[17] both published in the journal CBE Views (now Science Editor). The survey sparked an editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.[18] These early papers used the term ""author's editor"" (with author in singular) but today, when academic papers usually have multiple authors, the pluralized term ""authors' editor"" is becoming standard usage.
"
Author editing - Wikipedia,"The term ""authors' editor"" seems to have its roots in American literary publishing.[12] It was used in 1953, in the title of a Doctor of Education thesis, to describe Maxwell Perkins, a literary editor who helped shape American literature in the first half of the twentieth century.[19] The earliest use of the term in print is attributed to US novelist George Washington Cable in a 1910 tribute to his editor Richard Watson Gilder.[12]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Academic publishing is the subfield of publishing which distributes academic research and scholarship. Most academic work is published in academic journal article, book or thesis form. The part of academic written output that is not formally published but merely printed up or posted on the Internet is often called ""grey literature"". Most scientific and scholarly journals, and many academic and scholarly books, though not all, are based on some form of peer review or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication. Peer review quality and selectivity standards vary greatly from journal to journal, publisher to publisher, and field to field.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Most established academic disciplines have their own journals and other outlets for publication, although many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. There is also a tendency for existing journals to divide into specialized sections as the field itself becomes more specialized. Along with the variation in review and publication procedures, the kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions to knowledge or research differ greatly among fields and subfields. In the sciences, the desire for statistically significant results leads to publication bias.[1]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Academic publishing is undergoing major changes, as it makes the transition from the print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. An important trend, particularly with respect to journals in the sciences, is open access via the Internet. In open access publishing, a journal article is made available free for all on the web by the publisher at the time of publication. Both open and closed journals are sometimes funded by the author paying an article processing charge, thereby shifting some fees from the reader to the researcher or their funder.  Many open or closed journals fund their operations without such fees. The Internet has facilitated open access self-archiving, in which authors themselves make a copy of their published articles available free for all on the web.[2][3] Some important results[4] in mathematics have been published only on arXiv.[5][6]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The Journal des sçavans (later spelled Journal des savants), established by Denis de Sallo, was the earliest academic journal published in Europe. Its content included obituaries of famous men, church history, and legal reports.[7] The first issue appeared as a twelve-page quarto pamphlet[8] on Monday, 5 January 1665,[9] shortly before the first appearance of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, on 6 March 1665.[10]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as a monogram, reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both Isaac Newton and Leibniz used this approach. However, this method did not work well. Robert K. Merton, a sociologist, found that 92% of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72% in the 18th century, 59% by the latter half of the 19th century, and 33% by the first half of the 20th century.[11] The decline in contested claims for priority in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals, with estimates suggesting that around 50 million journal articles[12] have been published since the first appearance of the Philosophical Transactions. The Royal Society was steadfast in its not-yet-popular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Early scientific journals embraced several models: some were run by a single individual who exerted editorial control over the contents, often simply publishing extracts from colleagues' letters, while others employed a group decision making process, more closely aligned to modern peer review. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that peer review became the standard.[13]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In the 1960s and 1970s, commercial publishers began to selectively acquire ""top-quality"" journals that were previously published by nonprofit academic societies. When the commercial publishers raised the subscription prices significantly, they lost little of the market, due to the inelastic demand for these journals. Although there are over 2,000 publishers, five for-profit companies (Reed Elsevier, Springer Science+Business Media, Wiley-Blackwell, Taylor & Francis, and Sage) accounted for 50% of articles published in 2013.[14][15] (Since 2013, Springer Science+Business Media has undergone a merger to form an even bigger company named Springer Nature.) Available data indicate that these companies have profit margins of around 40% making it one of the most profitable industries,[16][17] especially compared to the smaller publishers, which likely operate with low margins.[18] These factors have contributed to the ""serials crisis"" – total expenditures on serials increased 7.6% per year from 1986 to 2005, yet the number of serials purchased increased an average of only 1.9% per year.[19]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Unlike most industries, in academic publishing the two most important inputs are provided ""virtually free of charge"".[18] These are the articles and the peer review process. Publishers argue that they add value to the publishing process through support to the peer review group, including stipends, as well as through typesetting, printing, and web publishing. Investment analysts, however, have been skeptical of the value added by for-profit publishers, as exemplified by a 2005 Deutsche Bank analysis which stated that ""we believe the publisher adds relatively little value to the publishing process... We are simply observing that if the process really were as complex, costly and value-added as the publishers protest that it is,  40% margins wouldn't be available.""[18][16]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"A crisis in academic publishing is ""widely perceived"";[20] the apparent crisis has to do with the combined pressure of budget cuts at universities and increased costs for journals (the serials crisis).[21] The university budget cuts have reduced library budgets and reduced subsidies to university-affiliated publishers. The humanities have been particularly affected by the pressure on university publishers, which are less able to publish monographs when libraries can not afford to purchase them. For example, the ARL found that in ""1986, libraries spent 44% of their budgets on books compared with 56% on journals; twelve years later, the ratio had skewed to 28% and 72%.""[20] Meanwhile, monographs are increasingly expected for tenure in the humanities. In 2002 the Modern Language Association expressed hope that electronic publishing would solve the issue.[20]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In 2009 and 2010, surveys and reports found that libraries faced continuing budget cuts, with one survey in 2009 finding that one-third of libraries had their budgets cut by 5% or more.[22]
In the 2010s, libraries began more aggressive cost cutting with the leverage of open access and open data. Data analysis with open source tools like Unpaywall Journals empowered library systems in reducing their subscription costs by 70 % with the cancellation of the big deal with publishers like Elsevier.[23]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Several models are being investigated, such as open publication models or adding community-oriented features.[24]
It is also considered that ""Online scientific interaction outside the traditional journal space is becoming more and more important to academic communication"".[25] In addition, experts have suggested measures to make the publication process more efficient in disseminating new and important findings by evaluating the worthiness of publication on the basis of the significance and novelty of the research finding.[26]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In academic publishing, a paper is an academic work that is usually published in an academic journal. It contains original research results or reviews existing results. Such a paper, also called an article, will only be considered valid if it undergoes a process of peer review by one or more referees (who are academics in the same field) who check that the content of the paper is suitable for publication in the journal. A paper may undergo a series of reviews, revisions, and re-submissions before finally being accepted or rejected for publication. This process typically takes several months. Next, there is often a delay of many months (or in some fields, over a year) before an accepted manuscript appears.[27] This is particularly true for the most popular journals where the number of accepted articles often outnumbers the space for printing. Due to this, many academics self-archive a 'pre-print' copy of their paper for free download from their personal or institutional website.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Some journals, particularly newer ones, are now published in electronic form only. Paper journals are now generally made available in electronic form as well, both to individual subscribers, and to libraries. Almost always these electronic versions are available to subscribers immediately upon publication of the paper version, or even before; sometimes they are also made available to non-subscribers, either immediately (by open access journals) or after an embargo of anywhere from two to twenty-four months or more, in order to protect against loss of subscriptions. Journals having this delayed availability are sometimes called delayed open access journals. Ellison in 2011 reported that in economics the dramatic increase in opportunities to publish results online has led to a decline in the use of peer-reviewed articles.[28]

The list of important scientific papers that were initially rejected by peer-reviewed journals goes back at least as far as the editor of Philosophical Transaction's 1796 rejection of Edward Jenner's report of the first vaccination against smallpox.[32] 
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"""Confirmatory bias"" is the unconscious tendency to accept reports which support the reviewer's views and to downplay those which do not. Experimental studies show the problem exists in peer reviewing.[33]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The process of academic publishing, which begins when authors submit a manuscript to a publisher, is divided into two distinct phases: peer review and production.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The process of peer review is organized by the journal editor and is complete when the content of the article, together with any associated images or figures, are accepted for publication. The peer review process is increasingly managed online, through the use of proprietary systems, commercial software packages, or open source and free software. A manuscript undergoes one or more rounds of review; after each round, the author(s) of the article modify their submission in line with the reviewers' comments; this process is repeated until the editor is satisfied and the work is accepted.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The production process, controlled by a production editor or publisher, then takes an article through copy editing, typesetting, inclusion in a specific issue of a journal, and then printing and online publication. Academic copy editing seeks to ensure that an article conforms to the journal's house style, that all of the referencing and labelling is correct, and that the text is consistent and legible; often this work involves substantive editing and negotiating with the authors.[34] Because the work of academic copy editors can overlap with that of authors' editors,[35] editors employed by journal publishers often refer to themselves as “manuscript editors”.[34]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In much of the 20th century, such articles were photographed for printing into proceedings and journals, and this stage was known as camera-ready copy. With modern digital submission in formats such as PDF, this photographing step is no longer necessary, though the term is still sometimes used.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The author will review and correct proofs at one or more stages in the production process. The proof correction cycle has historically been labour-intensive as handwritten comments by authors and editors are manually transcribed by a proof reader onto a clean version of the proof. In the early 21st century, this process was streamlined by the introduction of e-annotations in Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, and other programs, but it still remained a time-consuming and error-prone process. The full automation of the proof correction cycles has only become possible with the onset of online collaborative writing platforms, such as Authorea, Google Docs, and various others, where a remote service oversees the copy-editing interactions of multiple authors and exposes them as explicit, actionable historic events.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Academic authors cite sources they have used, in order to support their assertions and arguments and to help readers find more information on the subject. It also gives credit to authors whose work they use and helps avoid plagiarism. The topic of dual publication (also known as self-plagiarism) has been addressed by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), as well as in the research literature itself.[36][37][38]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Each scholarly journal uses a specific format for citations (also known as references). Among the most common formats used in research papers are the APA, CMS, and MLA styles.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The American Psychological Association (APA) style is often used in the social sciences. The Chicago Manual of Style (CMS) is used in business, communications, economics, and social sciences. The CMS style uses footnotes at the bottom of page to help readers locate the sources. The Modern Language Association (MLA) style is widely used in the humanities.

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Scientific, technical, and medical (STM) literature is a large industry which generated $23.5 billion in revenue; $9.4 billion of that was specifically from the publication of English-language scholarly journals.[39] Most scientific research is initially published in scientific journals and considered to be a primary source. Technical reports, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), round out the primary literature. Secondary sources in the sciences include articles in review journals (which provide a synthesis of research articles on a topic to highlight advances and new lines of research), and books for large projects, broad arguments, or compilations of articles. Tertiary sources might include encyclopedias and similar works intended for broad public consumption or academic libraries.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"A partial exception to scientific publication practices is in many fields of applied science, particularly that of U.S. computer science research. An equally prestigious site of publication within U.S. computer science are some academic conferences.[40] Reasons for this departure include a large number of such conferences, the quick pace of research progress, and computer science professional society support for the distribution and archiving of conference proceedings.[41]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Publishing in the social sciences is very different in different fields. Some fields, like economics, may have very ""hard"" or highly quantitative standards for publication, much like the natural sciences. Others, like anthropology or sociology, emphasize field work and reporting on first-hand observation as well as quantitative work. Some social science fields, such as public health or demography, have significant shared interests with professions like law and medicine, and scholars in these fields often also publish in professional magazines.[42]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Publishing in the humanities is in principle similar to publishing elsewhere in the academy; a range of journals, from general to extremely specialized, are available, and university presses issue many new humanities books every year.  The arrival of online publishing opportunities has radically transformed the economics of the field and the shape of the future is controversial.[43] Unlike science, where timeliness is critically important, humanities publications often take years to write and years more to publish. Unlike the sciences, research is most often an individual process and is seldom supported by large grants. Journals rarely make profits and are typically run by university departments.[44]

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The following describes the situation in the United States. In many fields, such as literature and history, several published articles are typically required for a first tenure-track job, and a published or forthcoming book is now often required before tenure. Some critics complain that this de facto system has emerged without thought to its consequences; they claim that the predictable result is the publication of much shoddy work, as well as unreasonable demands on the already limited research time of young scholars. To make matters worse, the circulation of many humanities journals in the 1990s declined to almost untenable levels, as many libraries cancelled subscriptions, leaving fewer and fewer peer-reviewed outlets for publication; and many humanities professors' first books sell only a few hundred copies, which often does not pay for the cost of their printing. Some scholars have called for a publication subvention of a few thousand dollars to be associated with each graduate student fellowship or new tenure-track hire, in order to alleviate the financial pressure on journals.

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Under Open Access, the content can be freely accessed and reused by anyone in the world using an Internet connection.

The impact of the work available as Open Access is maximised because, quoting the Library of Trinity College Dublin:[45]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Open Access is often confused with specific funding models such as Article Processing Charge (APC) being paid by authors or their funders, sometimes misleadingly called ""open access model"". The reason this term is misleading is due to the existence of many other models, including funding sources listed in the original the Budapest Open Access Initiative Declaration: ""the foundations and governments that fund research, the universities and laboratories that employ researchers, endowments set up by discipline or institution, friends of the cause of open access, profits from the sale of add-ons to the basic texts, funds freed up by the demise or cancellation of journals charging traditional subscription or access fees, or even contributions from the researchers themselves"". For more recent open public discussion of open access funding models, see Flexible membership funding model for Open Access publishing with no author-facing charges.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Prestige journals using the APC model often charge several thousand dollars. Oxford University Press, with over 300 journals, has fees ranging from  £1000-£2500, with discounts of 50% to 100% to authors from developing countries.[46]  Wiley Blackwell has 700 journals available, and they charge different amounts for each journal.[47]  Springer, with over 2600 journals, charges US$3000 or EUR 2200 (excluding VAT).[48]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"The online distribution of individual articles and academic journals then takes place without charge to readers and libraries. Most open access journals remove all the financial, technical, and legal barriers that limit access to academic materials to paying customers. The Public Library of Science and BioMed Central are prominent examples of this model.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Fee-based open access publishing has been criticized on quality grounds, as the desire to maximize publishing fees could cause some journals to relax the standard of peer review. Although, similar desire is also present in the subscription model, where publishers increase numbers or published articles in order to justify raising their fees. It may be criticized on financial grounds as well because the necessary publication or subscription fees have proven to be higher than originally expected. Open access advocates generally reply that because open access is as much based on peer reviewing as traditional publishing, the quality should be the same (recognizing that both traditional and open access journals have a range of quality). It has also been argued that good science done by academic institutions who cannot afford to pay for open access might not get published at all, but most open access journals permit the waiver of the fee for financial hardship or authors in underdeveloped countries. In any case, all authors have the option of self-archiving their articles in their institutional repositories or disciplinary repositories in order to make them open access, whether or not they publish them in a journal.
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"If they publish in a Hybrid open access journal, authors or their funders pay a subscription journal a publication fee to make their individual article open access. The other articles in such hybrid journals are either made available after a delay or remain available only by subscription. Most traditional publishers (including Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford University Press, and Springer Science+Business Media) have already introduced such a hybrid option, and more are following. The fraction of the authors of a hybrid open access journal that makes use of its open access option can, however, be small. It also remains unclear whether this is practical in fields outside the sciences, where there is much less availability of outside funding. In 2006, several funding agencies, including the Wellcome Trust and several divisions of the Research Councils in the UK announced the availability of extra funding to their grantees for such open access journal publication fees.

Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"In recent decades there has been a growth in academic publishing in developing countries as they become more advanced in science and technology. Although the large majority of scientific output and academic documents are produced in developed countries, the rate of growth in these countries has stabilized and is much smaller than the growth rate in some of the developing countries. The fastest scientific output growth rate over the last two decades has been in the Middle East and Asia with Iran leading with an 11-fold increase followed by the Republic of Korea, Turkey, Cyprus, China, and Oman.[51] In comparison, the only G8 countries in top 20 ranking with fastest performance improvement are, Italy which stands at tenth and Canada at 13th globally.[52][53]

The report predicted that China would overtake the United States sometime before 2020, possibly as early as 2013. China's scientific impact, as measured by other scientists citing the published papers the next year, is smaller although also increasing.[55]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"There is increasing frustration amongst OA advocates, with what is perceived as resistance to change on the part of many of the established academic publishers. Publishers are often accused of capturing and monetising publicly-funded research, using free academic labour for peer review, and then selling the resulting publications back to academia at inflated profits.[56] Such frustrations sometimes spill over into hyperbole, of which ""publishers add no value"" is one of the most common examples.[57]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"However, scholarly publishing is not a simple process, and publishers do add value to scholarly communication as it is currently designed.[58] Kent Anderson maintains a list of things that journal publishers do which currently contains 102 items and has yet to be formally contested from anyone who challenges the value of publishers.[59] Many items on the list could be argued to be of value primarily to the publishers themselves, e.g. ""Make money and remain a constant in the system of scholarly output"". However, others provide direct value to researchers and research in steering the academic literature. This includes arbitrating disputes (e.g. over ethics, authorship), stewarding the scholarly record, copy-editing, proofreading, type-setting, styling of materials, linking the articles to open and accessible datasets, and (perhaps most importantly) arranging and managing scholarly peer review. The latter is a task that should not be underestimated as it effectively entails coercing busy people into giving their time to improve someone else's work and maintain the quality of the literature. Not to mention the standard management processes for large enterprises, including infrastructure, people, security, and marketing. All of these factors contribute in one way or another to maintaining the scholarly record.[57]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"It could be questioned though, whether these functions are actually necessary to the core aim of scholarly communication, namely, dissemination of research to researchers and other stakeholders such as policy makers, economic, biomedical and industrial practitioners as well as the general public. Above, for example, we question the necessity of the current infrastructure for peer review, and if a scholar-led crowdsourced alternative may be preferable. In addition, one of the biggest tensions in this space is associated with the question if for-profit companies (or the private sector) should be allowed to be in charge of the management and dissemination of academic output and execute their powers while serving, for the most part, their own interests. This is often considered alongside the value added by such companies, and therefore the two are closely linked as part of broader questions on appropriate expenditure of public funds, the role of commercial entities in the public sector, and issues around the privatisation of scholarly knowledge.[57]
"
Academic publishing - Wikipedia,"Publishing could certainly be done at a lower cost than common at present. There are significant researcher-facing inefficiencies in the system including the common scenario of multiple rounds of rejection and resubmission to various venues as well as the fact that some publishers profit beyond reasonable scale.[60] What is missing most[57] from the current publishing market, is transparency about the nature and the quality of the services publishers offer. This would allow authors to make informed choices, rather than decisions based on indicators that are unrelated to research quality, such as the JIF.[57] All the above questions are being investigated and alternatives could be considered and explored. Yet, in the current system, publishers still play a role in managing processes of quality assurance, interlinking and findability of research. As the role of scholarly publishers within the knowledge communication industry continues to evolve, it is seen as necessary[57] that they can justify their operation based on the intrinsic value that they add,[61][62] and combat the perception that they add no value to the process.

Philosophical realism - Wikipedia,"Philosophical realism is a broad family of philosophies regarding the properties and contents of reality. Realism may refer to a number of positions within metaphysics and epistemology, which express that a given thing exists in reality independently of knowledge or understanding. This can apply to items such as the physical world, the past and future, other minds, and the self, as well as to those such as universals, mathematical truths, moral truths, and thought itself. Realism may also take the form of an affirmation of appearances, in opposition to metaphysical treatments of reality entirely.
"
Philosophical realism - Wikipedia,"Realism can also be a view about the properties of reality in general, holding that reality exists independent of the mind, as opposed to non-realist views (like some forms of skepticism and solipsism) which question the certainty of anything beyond one's own mind. Philosophers who profess realism often claim that truth consists in a correspondence between cognitive representations and reality.[1]

Philosophical realism - Wikipedia,"Naive realism, also known as direct realism, is a philosophy of mind rooted in a common sense theory of perception that claims that the senses provide us with direct awareness of the external world. In contrast, some forms of idealism assert that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas and some forms of skepticism say we cannot trust our senses. The naive realist view is that objects have properties, such as texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually perceived absolutely correctly. We perceive them as they really are.

Philosophical realism - Wikipedia,"Scientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be.  Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question ""how is the success of science to be explained?"" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make reliable claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as observables. Analytic philosophers generally have a commitment to scientific realism, in the sense of regarding the scientific method as a reliable guide to the nature of reality. The main alternative to scientific realism is instrumentalism.[5]

Philosophical realism - Wikipedia,"Realism in physics (especially quantum mechanics) is the claim that the world is in some sense mind-independent: that even if the results of a possible measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer (contrary to the ""consciousness causes collapse"" interpretation of quantum mechanics). That interpretation of quantum mechanics, on the other hand, states that the wave function is already the full description of reality. The different possible realities described by the wave function are equally true. The observer collapses the wave function into their own reality. One's reality can be mind-dependent under this interpretation of quantum mechanics.

As universals were considered by Plato to be ideal forms, this stance is confusingly also called Platonic idealism. This should not be confused with Idealism, as presented by philosophers such as George Berkeley: as Platonic abstractions are not spatial, temporal, or mental, they are not compatible with the latter Idealism's emphasis on mental existence. Plato's Forms include numbers and geometrical figures, making them a theory of mathematical realism; they also include the Form of the Good, making them in addition a theory of ethical realism.

Realism (also known as exaggerated realism) in this context, contrasted with conceptualism and nominalism, holds that such universals really exist, independently and somehow prior to the world. Moderate realism holds that they exist, but only insofar as they are instantiated in specific things; they do not exist separately from the specific thing. Conceptualism holds that they exist, but only in the mind, while nominalism holds that universals do not ""exist"" at all but are no more than words (flatus vocis) that describe specific objects.

Philosophical realism - Wikipedia,"In early modern philosophy, Scottish Common Sense Realism was a school of philosophy that sought to defend naive realism against philosophical paradox and scepticism, arguing that matters of common sense are within the reach of common understanding and that common-sense beliefs even govern the lives and thoughts of those who hold non-commonsensical beliefs. It originated in the ideas of the most prominent members of the Scottish School of Common Sense, Thomas Reid, Adam Ferguson and Dugald Stewart, during the 18th century Scottish Enlightenment and flourished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Scotland and America.

Philosophical realism - Wikipedia,"The roots of Scottish Common Sense Realism can be found in responses to such philosophers as John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. The approach was a response to the ""ideal system"" that began with Descartes' concept of the limitations of sense experience and led Locke and Hume to a skepticism that called religion and the evidence of the senses equally into question. The common sense realists found skepticism to be absurd and so contrary to common experience that it had to be rejected. They taught that ordinary experiences provide intuitively certain assurance of the existence of the self, of real objects that could be seen and felt and of certain ""first principles"" upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. Its basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:[11]

Fideism - Wikipedia,"Fideism (/ˈfiːdeɪɪzəm, ˈfaɪdi-/) is an epistemological theory which maintains that faith is independent of reason, or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). The word fideism comes from fides, the Latin word for faith, and literally means ""faith-ism"".[1] Philosophers have identified a number of different forms of fideism.[2]
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Theologians and philosophers have responded in various ways to the place of faith and reason in determining the truth of metaphysical ideas, morality, and religious beliefs. A fideist is one who argues for fideism. Historically, fideism is most commonly ascribed to four philosophers: Blaise Pascal, Søren Kierkegaard, William James, and Ludwig Wittgenstein; with fideism being a label applied in a negative sense by their opponents, but which is not always supported by their own ideas and works or followers.[3] A qualified form of fideism is sometimes attributed to Immanuel Kant’s famous suggestion that we must “deny knowledge in order to make room for faith”.[4]
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Alvin Plantinga defines ""fideism"" as ""the exclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason and utilized especially in the pursuit of philosophical or religious truth"". The fideist therefore ""urges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters philosophical and religious"", and therefore may go on to disparage the claims of reason.[6]  The fideist seeks truth, above all: and affirms that reason cannot achieve certain kinds of truth, which must instead be accepted only by faith.[5]

Fideism - Wikipedia,"Tertullian's statement, however, is not a fideist position; Tertullian was critiquing intellectual arrogance and the misuse of philosophy, but he remained committed to reason and its usefulness in defending the faith.[1][10]
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Martin Luther taught that faith informs the Christian's use of reason. Regarding the mysteries of Christian faith, he wrote, ""All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false."" And ""Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has."" However, Luther conceded that, grounded upon faith in Christ, reason can be used in its proper realm, as he wrote, ""Before faith and the knowledge of God reason is darkness in divine matters, but through faith it is turned into a light in the believer and serves piety as an excellent instrument. For just as all natural endowments serve to further impiety in the godless, so they serve to further salvation in the godly. An eloquent tongue promotes faith; reason makes speech clear, and everything helps faith forward. Reason receives life from faith; it is killed by it and brought back to life.""[11]
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Another form of fideism is assumed by Pascal's Wager, which is a rational argument for a pragmatic view of God's existence.[12] Blaise Pascal invites the atheist considering faith to see faith in God as a cost-free choice that carries a potential reward.[13] He does not attempt to argue that God indeed exists, only that it might be valuable to assume that it is true. Of course, the problem with Pascal's Wager is that it does not restrict itself to a specific God, although Pascal did have in mind the Christian God as is mentioned in the following quote. In his Pensées, Pascal writes:
"
Fideism - Wikipedia," Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, since they profess belief in a religion which they cannot explain? They declare, when they expound it to the world, that it is foolishness, stultitiam; and then you complain because they do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is through their lack of proofs that they show they are not lacking in sense. "
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Pascal moreover contests the various proposed proofs of the existence of God as irrelevant. Even if the proofs were valid, the beings they propose to demonstrate are not congruent with the deity worshiped by historical faiths, and can easily lead to deism instead of revealed religion: ""The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—not the god of the philosophers!""[14]
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Considered to be the father of modern antirationalism, Johann Georg Hamann promoted a view that elevated faith alone as the only guide to human conduct. Using the work of David Hume he argued that everything people do is ultimately based on faith.[15] Without faith (for it can never be proven) in the existence of an external world, human affairs could not continue; therefore, he argued, all reasoning comes from this faith: it is fundamental to the human condition. Thus all attempts to base belief in God using reason are in vain. He attacks systems like Spinozism that try to confine what he feels is the infinite majesty of God into a finite human creation.[16]
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Hamann was a good personal friend of Immanuel Kant, one of the most influential philosophers of the modern era. While Kant and Hamann vociferously disagreed about both the use of reason and the scientific method, there were also a number of important points of agreement between them.[17] For instance, one of the core views defended in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is that reason is incapable of attaining knowledge of the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, a point which Hamann would agree with. The most important difference on this point is that Kant did not think that this gave way to antirationalism, whereas Hamann did.[17] As a result, a qualified form of fideism is sometimes attributed to Kant. This modified form of fideism is also evident in his famous suggestion that we must “deny knowledge in order to make room for faith”.[4]
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Natural theologians may argue that Kierkegaard was a fideist of this general sort: the argument that God's existence cannot be certainly known, and that the decision to accept faith is neither founded on, nor needs, rational justification, may be found in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard and his followers in Christian existentialism. Many of Kierkegaard's works, including Fear and Trembling, are under pseudonyms; they may represent the work of fictional authors whose views correspond to hypothetical positions, not necessarily those held by Kierkegaard himself.
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"In Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard focused on Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac. The New Testament apostles repeatedly argued that Abraham's act was an admirable display of faith. To the eyes of a non-believer, however, it must necessarily have appeared to be an unjustifiable attempted murder, perhaps the fruit of an insane delusion. Kierkegaard used this example to focus attention on the problem of faith in general.[18] He ultimately affirmed that to believe in the incarnation of Christ, in God made flesh, was to believe in the ""absolute paradox"", since it implies that an eternal, perfect being would become a simple human. Reason cannot possibly comprehend such a phenomenon; therefore, one can only believe in it by taking a ""leap of faith"".
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"American pragmatic philosopher and psychologist William James introduced his concept of the ""will to believe"" in 1896. Following upon his earlier theories of truth, James argued that some religious questions can only be answered by believing in the first place: one cannot know if religious doctrines are true without seeing if they work, but they cannot be said to work unless one believes them in the first place.
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"William James published many works on the subject of religious experience. His four key characteristics of religious experience are: 'passivity', 'ineffability', 'a noetic quality', and 'transiency'. Due to the fact that religious experience is fundamentally ineffable, it is impossible to hold a coherent discussion of it using public language. This means that religious belief cannot be discussed effectively, and so reason does not affect faith. Instead, faith is found through experience of the spiritual, and so understanding of belief is only gained through the practice of it.

Fideism - Wikipedia,"The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein did not write systematically about religion, though he did lecture on the topic. Some of his students' notes have been collected and published. On the other hand, it has been asserted that religion as a ""form of life"" is something that intrigued Wittgenstein to a great degree. In his 1967 article, entitled ""Wittgensteinian Fideism"", Kai Nielsen argues that certain aspects of Wittgenstein's thought have been interpreted by Wittgensteinians in a ""fideistic"" manner. According to this position, religion is a self-contained—and primarily expressive—enterprise, governed by its own internal logic or ""grammar"". This view—commonly called Wittgensteinian fideism—states: (1) that religion is logically cut off from other aspects of life; (2) that religious concepts and discourse are essentially self-referential; and (3) that religion cannot be criticized from an external (i.e., non-religious) point of view.[3] Although there are other aspects that are often associated with the phenomena of Wittgensteinian fideism, Kai Nielsen has argued that such interpretations are implausible misrepresentations of the position. It is worth noting, however, that no self-proclaimed Wittgensteinian actually takes Nielsen's analysis to be at all representative of either Wittgenstein's view, or their own.[citation needed] This is especially true of the best-known Wittgensteinian philosopher of religion, D. Z. Phillips, who is also the best-known ""Wittgensteinan fideist"". In their book Wittgensteinian Fideism? (SCM Press, 2005), D. Z. Phillips and Kai Nielsen debate the status of Wittgensteinian fideism. Both agree that the position ""collapses"", though they think it fails for different reasons. For Nielsen, the position is socially and politically irresponsible since it ignores prudential, practical, and pragmatic considerations as a basis for criticizing different language games. For Phillips, the position fails because it is not Wittgensteinian, and thus is a caricature of his position. Amongst other charges, Nielsen argues most forcefully in an article entitled ""On Obstacles of the Will"" that Phillips' Wittgensteinian view is relevantly fideistic and that it, therefore, fails on the grounds that it cannot account for the possibility of external, cultural criticism. Phillips, in turn, in the last article in the book, entitled ""Wittgenstein: Contemplation and Cultural Criticism"", argues that the position is not Wittgensteinian at all, and that Wittgenstein's considered view not only allows for the possibility of external, cultural criticism, but also ""advances"" philosophical discussion concerning it.

Fideism - Wikipedia,"Presuppositional apologetics is a Christian system of apologetics associated mainly with Calvinist Protestantism; it attempts to distinguish itself from fideism.[19] It holds that all human thought must begin with the proposition that the revelation contained in the Bible is axiomatic, rather than transcendentally necessary, else one would not be able to make sense of any human experience (see also epistemic foundationalism). To non-believers who reject the notion that the truth about God, the world, and themselves can be found within the Bible, the presuppositional apologist attempts to demonstrate the incoherence of the epistemic foundations of the logical alternative by the use of what has come to be known as the ""Transcendental Argument for God's existence"" (TAG). On the other hand, some presuppositional apologists, such as Cornelius Van Til, believe that such a condition of true unbelief is impossible, claiming that all people actually believe in God (even if only on a subconscious level), whether they admit or deny it.
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Presuppositional apologetics could be seen as being more closely allied with foundationalism than fideism, though it has sometimes been critical of both.
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Catholic doctrine rejects fideism. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, representing Catholicism's great regard for Thomism, the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas, affirms that it is a Catholic doctrine that God's existence can indeed be demonstrated by reason. Aquinas' position, which is to be distinguished from rationalism, has deep roots in Western Christianity; it goes back to St. Anselm of Canterbury's observation that the role of reason was to explain faith more fully: fides quaerens intellectum, ""faith seeking understanding"", is his formula.
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"The official position of the Catholic Church is that while the existence of the one God can in fact be demonstrated by reason, nevertheless on account of the distortion of human nature caused by the first sin, humans can be deluded to deny the claims of reason that demonstrate God's existence. The Anti-Modernist oath promulgated by Pope Pius X required Catholics to affirm that:
"
Fideism - Wikipedia," God, the origin and end of all things, can be known with certainty by the natural light of reason from the created world (cf. Rom. 1:20), that is, from the visible works of creation, as a cause from its effects, and that, therefore, his existence can also be demonstrated ..."
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Similarly, the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that:
"
Fideism - Wikipedia," Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful. "
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Pope John Paul II's encyclical Fides et Ratio also affirms that God's existence is in fact demonstrable by reason, and that attempts to reason otherwise are the results of sin. In the encyclical, John Paul II warned against ""a resurgence of fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of rational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding of faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God"".
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Historically, there have been a number of fideist strains within the Catholic orbit. Catholic traditionalism, exemplified in the nineteenth century by Joseph de Maistre, emphasized faith in tradition as the means of divine revelation. The claims of reason are multiple, and various people have argued rationally for several contradictory things: in this environment, the safest course is to hold true to the faith that has been preserved through tradition, and to resolve to accept what the Church has historically taught. In his essay Du pape (""On the Pope""), de Maistre argued that it was historically inevitable that all of the Protestant churches would eventually seek reunification and refuge in the Catholic Church: science was the greater threat, it threatened all religious faith, and ""no religion can resist science, except one"".
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Another refuge of fideist thinking within the Catholic Church is the concept of ""signs of contradiction"".[20] According to this belief, the holiness of certain people and institutions is confirmed by the fact that other people contest their claims: this opposition is held to be worthy of comparison to the opposition met by Jesus Christ himself. This opposition and contradiction does not inherently prove something is true in Catholic thought, but only acts an additional possible indication of its truth. The idea of the sign of contradiction is related to the conviction that, while human reason is still operative, the distortion of fallen human nature causes concrete instances of reasoning to grope and often to go astray.
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Fideism has received criticism from theologians who argue that fideism is not a proper way to worship God. According to this position, if one does not attempt to understand what one believes, one is not really believing. ""Blind faith"" is not true faith. Notable articulations of this position include:
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Some critics argue that fideism can lead to relativism.[21] The existence of other religions puts a fundamental question to fideists—if faith is the only way to know the truth of God, how are we to know which God to have faith in? Fideism alone is not considered an adequate guide to distinguish true or morally valuable revelations from false ones. An apparent consequence of fideism is that all religious thinking becomes equal. The major monotheistic religions become on par with obscure fringe religions, as neither can be advocated or disputed.
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"Some critics note that people successfully use reason in their daily lives to solve problems and that reason has led to progressive increase of knowledge in the sphere of science. This gives credibility to reason and argumentative thinking as a proper method for seeking truth. Galileo Galilei, for example, said that ""I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.""
"
Fideism - Wikipedia,"On the other hand, according to these critics, there is no evidence that a religious faith that rejects reason would also serve us while seeking truth.
"
Theological noncognitivism - Wikipedia,"Theological noncognitivism is the position that religious language – specifically, words such as ""God"" – are not cognitively meaningful. It is sometimes considered synonymous with ignosticism.
"
Theological noncognitivism - Wikipedia,"Theological noncognitivists argue in different ways, depending on what one considers the ""theory of meaning"" to be.
"
Theological noncognitivism - Wikipedia,"One argument holds to the claim that definitions of God are irreducible, self-instituting relational,  circular. For example, a sentence stating that ""God is He who created everything, apart from Himself"", is seen as circular rather than an irreducible truth.
"
Theological noncognitivism - Wikipedia,"Michael Martin writing from a verificationist perspective concludes that religious language is meaningless because it is not verifiable.[1][2]
"
Theological noncognitivism - Wikipedia,"George H. Smith uses an attribute-based approach in an attempt to prove that there is no concept for God: he argues that there are no meaningful attributes, only negatively defined or relational attributes, making the term meaningless.
"
Theological noncognitivism - Wikipedia,"An example: Consider the proposition of the existence of a ""pink unicorn"". When asserting the proposition, one can use attributes to at least describe the concept such a cohesive idea is transferred in language. With no knowledge of ""pink unicorn"", it can be described minimally with the attributes ""pink"", ""horse"", and ""horn"". Only then can the proposition be accepted or rejected. The acceptance or rejection of the proposition is distinct from the concept.
"
Theological noncognitivism - Wikipedia,"It is asserted by Steven J. Conifer that to be a positive atheist, one who not only lacks a belief in gods but who furthermore denies that gods exist, is to give credence to the existence of a concept of something for God to refer to, because it assumes that there is something understandable to not believe in.[3]

"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"The God Delusion is a 2006 book by English biologist Richard Dawkins, a professorial fellow at New College, Oxford,[1][2] and former holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford.
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"In The God Delusion, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator, God, almost certainly does not exist, and that belief in a personal god qualifies as a delusion, which he defines as a persistent false belief held in the face of strong contradictory evidence. He is sympathetic to Robert Pirsig's statement in Lila (1991) that ""when one person suffers from a delusion it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion.""[3] With many examples, he explains that one does not need religion to be moral and that the roots of religion and of morality can be explained in non-religious terms.
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"In early December 2006, it reached number four in the New York Times Hardcover Non-Fiction Best Seller list after nine weeks on the list.[4] More than three million copies were sold.[5]
According to Dawkins in a 2016 interview with Matt Dillahunty, an unauthorised Arabic translation of this book has been downloaded 3 million times in Saudi Arabia.[6] The book has attracted widespread commentary, with many books written in response.
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Dawkins has argued against creationist explanations of life in his previous works on evolution. The theme of The Blind Watchmaker, published in 1986, is that evolution can explain the apparent design in nature. In The God Delusion he focuses directly on a wider range of arguments used for and against belief in the existence of a god (or gods).
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Dawkins identifies himself repeatedly as an atheist, while also pointing out that, in a sense, he is also agnostic, though ""only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden"".[7]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Dawkins had long wanted to write a book openly criticising religion, but his publisher had advised against it. By the year 2006, his publisher had warmed to the idea. Dawkins attributes this change of mind to ""four years of Bush"" (who ""literally said that God had told him to invade Iraq"").[8][9] By that time, a number of authors, including Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, who together with Dawkins were labelled ""The Unholy Trinity"" by Robert Weitzel, had already written books openly attacking religion.[10] According to the Amazon.co.uk retailer in August 2007, the book was the best-seller in their sales of books on religion and spirituality, with Hitchens's God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything coming second. This led to a 50% growth in that category over the three years to that date.[11]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Dawkins dedicates the book to Douglas Adams and quotes the novelist: ""Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?""[12]:7 The book contains ten chapters. The first few chapters make a case that there almost certainly is no God, while the rest discuss religion and morality.
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Dawkins writes that The God Delusion contains four ""consciousness-raising"" messages:
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Chapter one, ""A deeply religious non-believer"", seeks to clarify the difference between what Dawkins terms ""Einsteinian religion"" and ""supernatural religion"". He notes that the former includes quasi-mystical and pantheistic references to God in the work of physicists like Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, and describes such pantheism as ""sexed up atheism"". Dawkins instead takes issue with the theism present in religions like Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.[13] The proposed existence of this interventionist God, which Dawkins calls the ""God Hypothesis"", becomes an important theme in the book.[14] He maintains that the existence or non-existence of God is a scientific fact about the universe, which is discoverable in principle if not in practice.[15]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Dawkins summarises the main philosophical arguments on God's existence, singling out the argument from design for longer consideration. Dawkins concludes that evolution by natural selection can explain apparent design in nature.[3]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"He writes that one of the greatest challenges to the human intellect has been to explain ""how the complex, improbable design in the universe arises"", and suggests that there are two competing explanations:
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"This is the basic set-up of his argument against the existence of God, the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit,[16] where he argues that the first attempt is self-refuting, and the second approach is the way forward.[17]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"At the end of chapter 4 (""Why there almost certainly is no God""), Dawkins sums up his argument and states, ""The temptation [to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself] is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable"".[18] In addition, chapter 4 asserts that the alternative to the designer hypothesis is not chance, but natural selection.
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Dawkins does not claim to disprove God with absolute certainty. Instead, he suggests as a general principle that simpler explanations are preferable (see Occam's razor) and that an omniscient or omnipotent God must be extremely complex (Dawkins argues that it is logically impossible for a God to be simultaneously omniscient and omnipotent). As such he argues that the theory of a universe without a God is preferable to the theory of a universe with a God.[19]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"The second half of the book begins by exploring the roots of religion and seeking an explanation for its ubiquity across human cultures. Dawkins advocates the ""theory of religion as an accidental by-product – a misfiring of something useful""[20] as for example the mind's employment of intentional stance. Dawkins suggests that the theory of memes, and human susceptibility to religious memes in particular, can explain how religions might spread like ""mind viruses"" across societies.[21]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"He then turns to the subject of morality, maintaining that we do not need religion to be good. Instead, our morality has a Darwinian explanation: altruistic genes, selected through the process of evolution, give people natural empathy. He asks, ""would you commit murder, rape or robbery if you knew that no God existed?"" He argues that very few people would answer ""yes"", undermining the claim that religion is needed to make us behave morally. In support of this view, he surveys the history of morality, arguing that there is a moral Zeitgeist that continually evolves in society, generally progressing toward liberalism. As it progresses, this moral consensus influences how religious leaders interpret their holy writings. Thus, Dawkins states, morality does not originate from the Bible, rather our moral progress informs what part of the Bible Christians accept and what they now dismiss.[22]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"The God Delusion is not just a defence of atheism, but also goes on the offensive against religion. Dawkins sees religion as subverting science, fostering fanaticism, encouraging bigotry against homosexuals, and influencing society in other negative ways.[23] Dawkins regards religion as a ""divisive force"" and as a ""label for in-group/out-group enmity and vendetta"".[24]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"He is most outraged about the teaching of religion in schools, which he considers to be an indoctrination process. He equates the religious teaching of children by parents and teachers in faith schools to a form of mental abuse. Dawkins considers the labels ""Muslim child"" and ""Catholic child"" equally misapplied as the descriptions ""Marxist child"" and ""Tory child"", as he wonders how a young child can be considered developed enough to have such independent views on the cosmos and humanity's place within it.
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"The book concludes with the question of whether religion, despite its alleged problems, fills a ""much needed gap"", giving consolation and inspiration to people who need it. According to Dawkins, these needs are much better filled by non-religious means such as philosophy and science. He suggests that an atheistic worldview is life-affirming in a way that religion, with its unsatisfying ""answers"" to life's mysteries, could never be. An appendix gives addresses for those ""needing support in escaping religion"".
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"The book provoked an immediate response, both positive and negative, and was published with endorsements from scientists, such as Nobel laureate and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA James D. Watson, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, as well as the popular writers of fiction and illusionists Penn and Teller.[25] Metacritic reported that the book had a weighted average score of 59 out of 100.[26] The book was nominated for Best Book at the British Book Awards, where Richard Dawkins was named Author of the Year.[27] Nevertheless, the book received mixed reviews from critics, including both religious and atheist commentators.[28][29] In the London Review of Books, Terry Eagleton accused Richard Dawkins of not doing proper research into the topic of his work, religion, and further agreed with critics who accused Dawkins of committing straw man fallacies against theists (something Dawkins rebuts).[30]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Oxford theologian Alister McGrath (author of The Dawkins Delusion? and Dawkins' God) argues that Dawkins is ignorant of Christian theology, and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently.[31] In reply, Dawkins asks: ""Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?"",[32] and—in the paperback edition of The God Delusion—he refers to the American biologist PZ Myers, who has satirised this line of argument as ""The Courtier's Reply"".[33] Dawkins had an extended debate with McGrath at the 2007 Sunday Times Literary Festival.[34]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Eastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart says that Dawkins ""devoted several pages of The God Delusion to a discussion of the 'Five Ways' of Thomas Aquinas but never thought to avail himself of the services of some scholar of ancient and mediaeval thought who might have explained them to him ... As a result, he not only mistook the Five Ways for Thomas's comprehensive statement on why we should believe in God, which they most definitely are not, but ended up completely misrepresenting the logic of every single one of them, and at the most basic levels.""[35]

"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Ethicist Margaret Somerville,[36] suggested that Dawkins ""overstates the case against religion"",[37] particularly its role in human conflict.
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Many of Dawkins' defenders claim that critics generally misunderstand his real point. During a debate on Radio 3 Hong Kong, David Nicholls, writer and president of the Atheist Foundation of Australia, reiterated Dawkins' sentiments that religion is an ""unnecessary"" aspect of global problems.[38] Dawkins argues that ""the existence of God is a scientific hypothesis like any other"".[39] He disagrees with Stephen Jay Gould's principle of nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA). In an interview with the Time magazine, Dawkins said:
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,I think that Gould's separate compartments was a purely political ploy to win middle-of-the-road religious people to the science camp. But it's a very empty idea. There are plenty of places where religion does not keep off the scientific turf. Any belief in miracles is flat contradictory not just to the facts of science but to the spirit of science.[40]
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"Astrophysicist Martin Rees has suggested that Dawkins' attack on mainstream religion is unhelpful.[41] Regarding Rees' claim in his book Our Cosmic Habitat that ""such questions lie beyond science; however, they are the province of philosophers and theologians"", Dawkins asks ""what expertise can theologians bring to deep cosmological questions that scientists cannot?""[42][43] Elsewhere, Dawkins has written that ""there's all the difference in the world between a belief that one is prepared to defend by quoting evidence and logic, and a belief that is supported by nothing more than tradition, authority or revelation.""[44]
"
The God Delusion - Wikipedia,"On 3 October 2007, John Lennox, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford, publicly debated Richard Dawkins at the University of Alabama at Birmingham on Dawkins' views as expressed in The God Delusion, and their validity over and against the Christian faith.[45][46][47]
""The God Delusion Debate"" marked Dawkins' first visit to the Old South and the first significant discussion on this issue in the ""Bible Belt"".[48]
The event was sold out, and the Wall Street Journal called it ""a revelation: in Alabama, a civil debate over God's existence.""[49][50] Dawkins debated Lennox for the second time at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in October 2008. The debate was titled ""Has Science Buried God?"", in which Dawkins said that, although he would not accept it, a reasonably respectable case could be made for ""a deistic god, a sort of god of the physicist, a god of somebody like Paul Davies, who devised the laws of physics, god the mathematician, god who put together the cosmos in the first place and then sat back and watched everything happen"" but not for a theistic god.[51][52][53][54]

Dunedin Public Libraries - Wikipedia,"In 1905 a new book room measuring 24 feet by 9 feet was built as a connection between the librarian's cottage and the hall on the north side. By 1913 there were 107 subscribers and over 3000 books. In the late 1960s the County Council took over responsibility for the Hall and the Library. The committee continued to meet until 1974 as a County Council committee, and then the Library was quite on its own. It was visibly separated from the Hall also, because in that year the books were moved across the street to the RSA Community Centre, while the former library buildings were replaced by a chemist's shop, doctors rooms, and meeting rooms.

Unfortunately the building soon began to need frequent maintenance and it was obvious it was not a suitable place for a library which was expanding dramatically now that Waikouaiti was part of Dunedin City. With amalgamation the Library became part of the Dunedin Public Libraries network in 1989. The Community Centre was demolished and a new Waikouaiti Library was built in the last weeks of 1995.[7]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The 11th Street Bridges are a complex of three bridges across the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., United States. The bridges convey Interstate 695 across the Anacostia to its southern terminus at Interstate 295 and DC 295.[1] The bridges also connect the neighborhood of Anacostia with the rest of the city of Washington.[1]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The first bridge at the site, constructed about 1800, played a role in the War of 1812. It burned in 1846, but was repaired. A second bridge was constructed in 1873, and replaced in 1907. A modern, four-lane bridge replaced the older bridge in 1965, and a second four-lane bridge added in 1969.[2] In 2009, construction began on three spans (two carrying freeway traffic, one carrying local-only traffic) to replace the 1965 and 1969 bridges. The northbound bridge opened to traffic in December 2011 while the southbound bridge open to traffic in January 2012. The new bridges include new ramps and new interchanges with I-295 (the Anacostia Freeway). The local bridge opened to traffic in May 2012. Portions of all three bridges and their approaches remain under construction as of April 2013[update]. Phase 1 of the project was completed ahead of schedule and within budget in July 2013.[3] The local bridge was fully complete by September 2013.[4] Phase 2 of the project, including the conversion of the Barney Circle Freeway into a boulevard,[5] was completed in 2015.
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The first bridge across the Anacostia River in this area was the Eastern Branch Bridge,[6] a privately owned toll and drawbridge built between 1795 and 1800 about 0.25 miles (0.40 km) upstream from 11th Street SE (at the site of the current John Philip Sousa Bridge).[7][8] The Eastern Branch Bridge was blown up and partially burned by retreating American soldiers in August 1814 during the War of 1812.[9] It was rebuilt, but burned completely in August 1846.[7]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"In 1820, the privately owned ""Upper Navy Yard Bridge"" was built over the Anacostia River at 11th Street SE.[7][8] Also a toll bridge, this second bridge became a ""free"" bridge in 1848 after it was purchased by the federal government.[7]  From the city's founding until 1854, the area known today as Anacostia was primarily sparsely populated farmland.[8] But Anacostia was platted in 1854, and development slowly began to turn the agricultural land into businesses and residences.[8] The destruction of the Eastern Branch Bridge in 1846, however, significantly slowed growth in the area for five decades.[10]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"A second bridge was built in the same location as the Navy Yard Bridge in 1872–1873.[11] This bridge was replaced in 1905-1907 by a stronger, wider span (the ""Anacostia Bridge"") which accommodated streetcars.[12] It was this span which the Bonus Army fled across on July 28, 1932, when attacked by the United States Army.[13]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"Replacement of the 1907 span began in the 1960s. A modern, four-lane bridge carrying one-way northbound traffic opened next to the Anacostia Bridge on March 18, 1965 as part of the development of the ""Inner Loop"" (see below).[14][15] A second four-lane bridge replaced the Anacostia Bridge in 1969, with one-way traffic over the span of each bridge.[14][16]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The southbound structure was officially named the Officer Kevin J. Welsh Memorial Bridge, while the northbound structure was officially named the 11th Street Bridge.[1][17] Both were beam bridges: ""[The spans] are two-girder systems with steel composite construction and a central drop-in span on pin supports. The main girders are riveted and welded, and both have reinforced wall type piers with granite facing, supported by steel H piles.""[18] Each span was about 63 feet (19 m) wide.[14] Each bridge had roughly five sections—four sections of about 170 feet (52 m) in length, with a center section about 234 feet (71 m) in length.[14] Both spans were considered ""fracture critical,"" which means that if one girder in the span fails the entire bridge is likely to collapse.[14]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"In 1956, federal and regional transportation planners proposed an Inner Loop Expressway, one of three circumferential beltways for the District of Columbia.[19] The innermost beltway would have formed a flattened oval about a mile in radius centered on the White House.[19] The middle beltway would have formed an arc along the northern portion of the city, running from the proposed Barney Circle Freeway terminus near Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium to near 37th Street NW at the north end of Georgetown.[19]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"Two decades of protest led to the cancellation of all but the I-395 and I-695 portions of the plan.[19] The unbuilt portions of the project were finally cancelled in 1977.[19] Several ramps allowing traffic on the 11th Street Bridges to access I-295/Anacostia Freeway and I-695 eastbound remained unbuilt because of these cancellations, creating severe traffic problems on both ends of the bridges.[1][20]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The District of Columbia assessed the bridges in 2002. The Welsh Memorial Bridge was rated ""satisfactory"" (superstructure rating of 6; substructure rating of 6) while the 11th Street Bridge was rated ""fair to poor"" (superstructure rating of 5; substructure rating of 4).[1][21] Both superstructures were near maximum life expectancy.[1] In 2004, the two bridges carried 86,000 vehicles per day, the second-largest volume of the four ""middle Anacostia River"" bridge crossings.[1] Without improvements to traffic patterns across the Anacostia River, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) estimated in 2005 that traffic over the 11th Street Bridges would significantly expand to 105,100 vehicles per day by 2030, an increase of 22.2 percent over 2004 and more than 40.3 percent higher than the next-busiest bridge (Sousa Bridge).[1] DDOT undertook a major study of the bridges in 2004 which concluded that both bridges should be replaced.[22]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"Lane closures on the bridges, as well lane closures and other traffic restrictions on nearby local roads and on- and off-ramps, began October 26, 2010, as the construction moved from the middle of the Anacostia River toward the shore.[28] City engineers estimated that the project was 25 percent complete by late October 2010.[29] The project was on track for completion in 2013.[30] On November 5, 2010, construction crews began driving piles east of the bridge on its northern side to begin construction of the ramp connecting the new bridge to east-bound Southeast Freeway.[30]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The bridges' construction sparked some controversy.  On March 22, a citizens group named ""D.C. Jobs or Else"" organized a protest of about 50 individuals on the 11th Street Bridges.[33] Joined by D.C. Council member Marion Barry, the protesters said too few individuals from the Anacostia area (which suffers from a 30 percent unemployment rate) had been considered for employment or hired by Skanska/Facchina, the joint-venture construction company building the bridges.[33] Skanska/Facchina vice president Brook Brookshire denied the accusations, noting that 51 percent of the new hires were D.C. residents, the company had engaged in extensive outreach to the unemployed, and that the company had worked with local jobs organizations, the D.C. Department of Employment Services, and the D.C. Department of Transportation to find workers for the project.[34] Brookshire also said the company had provided training to unskilled workers to enable them to work on the project and find careers in the construction industry.[34]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"In May 2011, DDOT closed the off-ramp from the bridges to Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE.  The agency said the closure would create a larger work area and speed up construction of the new bridges and approaches.[35] Traffic was rerouted along the existing Good Hope Road on-ramp through the end of 2011,[35] although this meant the ramp now carried two-way traffic in a single lane each way. Significant afternoon rush-hour delays occurred in the area due to the rerouting.[35]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"In August 2011, the D.C. City Council designated the 11th Street Bridges, a portion of Southeast/Southwest Freeway, Maine Avenue SW, and Independence Avenue SW ""Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue"" in honor of the slain civil rights leader.  The dedication came in time for the planned dedication of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial.[36] The renaming was honorary, and did not formally change the names of these bridges, highways, and streets.[36]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The non-local spans were finished months ahead of schedule, and D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on December 16, 2011, to open the two bridges connecting I-295 with the Anacostia Freeway. The two spans were projected to carry 180,000 automobiles per day by 2032.[37] The inbound I-295 span opened on Monday, December 19, 2011.[38] The span carried both I-295 traffic as well as traffic coming up from neighborhood streets in Anacostia until the separate Anacostia-only span opened in 2013. Officials in December 2011 predicted the local-only span, which was intended to carry not only automobiles but also include bicycle and pedestrian lanes, would open in the summer of 2012.[37]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"Before the opening of the spans, DDOT received permission from the U.S. Department of Transportation to extend the designation of I-695 to the interchange with I-295.[39]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The opening of the new spans eliminated a dangerous portion of I-295 where motorists moving right to access the 11th Street Bridges mixed with motorists moving left as they entered the freeway from Firth Sterling Avenue SE. However, to allow local traffic access to the rest of the city, a set of temporary on- and off-ramps were made to give Anacostia residents access to the bridges.[40] In March 2012, DDOT also closed the ramp leading from I-695 to the 11th Street Bridges so that new approaches and connections to the new spans could be constructed.[41] Ten Metrobus routes were rerouted due to the span closure, adding significant travel times for Anacostia commuters.[42] Motorists attempting to reach Anacostia were forced to use one of three time-consuming alternative routes: exit I-395 at the Sixth Street SE ramp, travel through local streets, and use an on-ramp next to the Washington Navy Yard to access the undemolished old outbound bridge; continue onto I-295 and exit at Howard Road SE; exit onto South Capitol Street and take the Frederick Douglass Bridge; or continue east to the John Philip Sousa Bridge.[39]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"In January 2012, DDOT officials said that even when the third span opened in the summer of 2012, it would not be complete.  DDOT said that one of the outbound traffic lanes would not be complete, nor would the pedestrian/bike lane.  DDOT also admitted that Anacostia residents traveling into the city would not have direct access to M Street as originally planned.  Instead, motorists would confront a dead-end and be forced to take a detour east onto O Street SE, travel north on 12th Street NE, and then make a left to reach M Street SE.  DDOT said the final outbound lane to Anacostia as well as the bicycle/pedestrian lane would not be completed until the fall of 2012.[39]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"DDOT announced in April 2012 that it was on schedule to open the new ramp from the bridge to northbound Anacostia Freeway in June, and the new inbound-ramp on the north side of the bridge (connecting with I-395) in September.[43]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"Since the cancellation of the Inner Loop Expressway, motorists wanting to access the Baltimore–Washington Parkway or U.S. Route 50 in Maryland (the John Hanson Highway) would often travel Interstate 695 to Barney Circle, wait at the traffic light there, use Pennsylvania Avenue to cross the nearby Sousa Bridge, wait at a traffic light on the southwestern terminus of the bridge, and make a left turn against oncoming traffic to access a narrow and dangerous ramp that led to northbound D.C. Route 295 (the Anacostia Freeway). The combination of traffic lights, left turn, and mixing of both through-traffic and local traffic created extensive traffic congestion on the Sousa Bridge during evening rush hour.[44][45][46][47][48]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"In 2009, when the DDOT began the replacement of the 11th Street Bridges, it closed the westbound segment of Interstate 695 from the 11th Street Bridges to Barney Circle in late November 2012,[49] and the eastbound lanes in early 2013.[48] This portion of was Interstate 695 was subsequently decommissioned, turning roughly five blocks of six-lane highway into city streets from the National Highway System.[50] The unfinished ""mixing bowl"" exchange on the southern terminus of the 11th Street Bridges was also altered. Local traffic was separated from through-traffic by the construction of a bridge dedicated for local traffic only, and ramps connecting the bridge to D.C. Route 295 were created. Construction of the new ramps began in May 2012,[46] with the ramp from southbound D.C. Route 295 onto the 11th Street Bridge completed in July 2012.[47] The ramp from the bridges to northbound D.C. Route 295 opened on December 19, 2012.[51]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The decommissioned portion of Interstate 695 began to be transformed into a boulevard named ""Southeast Boulevard"".[47] The reconstruction project, estimated to take 18 to 24 months, raised the roadway 20 feet (6.1 m) to bring it level with the grade of the surrounding streets.[48] The six-lane former highway began to be turned into a four-lane grand boulevard with a landscaped median and pedestrian nature trail. Southeast Boulevard was designed to link Barney Circle to 11th Street SE.[47]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"In 2013, DDOT published plans to reconfigure Barney Circle. Priorities for the project included improving and restoring access to neighborhood streets, and adding pedestrian and bicycle connectivity to local streets and the Anacostia River waterfront. DDOT also began exploring whether to connect Southeast Boulevard to 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th Streets SE.[52] By 2014, DDOT's plan involved possible reconstructing of Barney Circle into an intermodal transportation hub as well. DDOT planners said that construction on this project might begin as early as 2016.[53]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The local span of the new 11th Street Bridges was designed to accommodate a lane for the trolley cars of the city's emerging DC Streetcar tram system.  The Anacostia Line of the streetcar system was originally intended to travel north from the Anacostia Metro station to a streetcar station at the southern foot of the local span before connecting with the Navy Yard – Ballpark and Waterfront Metro stations.[54] Design changes were made in the 11th Street Bridges to permit the streetcar tracks.[55]  In 2009, however, DDOT said the trolley cars would not travel down M Street SE/SW but rather proceed up 8th Street SE/NE to link with DC Streetcar's H Street Line.[55][56] To help fund construction of the Anacostia Line, DDOT proposed transferring $10 million from demolition of the 11th Street Bridges, but put that plan on hold due to delays in the streetcar project.[57]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"For reasons which remain unclear, DDOT shuttered construction of the Anacostia line in August 2010.[58] Funding for the Anacostia Line over the 11th Street Bridges subsequently fell through as well.  DDOT had applied for an $18 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant from the United States Department of Transportation to build the trolley bed and lay tracks along the local span, but the federal agency denied the application in October 2010.[59] Three days later, DDOT released a new DC Streetcar map showing the Anacostia Line terminating at the Anacostia Metro station.[60]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"However, in October 2009, construction began on the new United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters on what used to be the west campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital.[61] As the first DHS headquarters building neared completion,[62] the need for a streetcar line to move DHS workers from the Anacostia and Congressional Heights Metro lines into the heart of Anacostia became urgent. Federal and city officials also wanted to find a way to link the 8th Street Marine Corps Barracks and United States Navy facilities at the Washington Navy Yard to the DHS campus.  DDOT and the Federal Transit Administration began holding a series of public meetings to determine how to link the 11th Street Bridges with DHS.
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"By June 2011, three public meetings had been held, in which 10 alternate routes for the streetcar line had been identified.[63] In January 2012 the fourth public meeting narrowed the routes down to four alternatives for linking the Anacostia Metro station to the bridges.[64]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"DDOT originally planned to tear down the spans of the existing 11th Street Bridges, but leave the piers standing.  The agency planned to connect the bicycle/pedestrian lane on the new local-only span with two of the piers left over from the demolition of the downstream span.  Pedestrian observation platforms would be built on the piers.  At both ends of the local-only span, the city also proposed building fishing piers, which would extend into the Anacostia River.  The overlooks and fishing piers were expected to be completed in the fall of 2012 or the spring of 2013.[65]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"However, in March 2012 the Office of Planning within the D.C. Mayor's office proposed retaining the downstream span and turning it into a recreational destination.  The inspiration for the concept came from New York City's High Line,[66] a linear park and aerial greenway built on a section of the former elevated New York Central Railroad spur.[67] The Office of Planning's initial concept proposed building a new 925-foot (282 m) superstructure on the piers, complete with utilities (electricity, natural gas, sewage, fresh water).  A self-sustaining public-private partnership would develop parks, restaurants, and outdoor entertainment features on the span.[65] City planners argued the concept would connect parks and trails along both sides of the Anacostia River, provide a ""destination attraction"" in the city's impoverished Southeast which could enhance retail sales as well as economic development in the area, and provide badly needed outdoor recreational facilities to residents of the Anacostia neighborhood.[68][69] The cost of building a new span was estimated at between $25 and $35 million.[70]
"
11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"The city made its planning proposal about 45 to 60 days before demolition was to have begun on the existing span.[65] It said it would hold a national design competition in the summer of 2012.[68]

11th Street Bridges - Wikipedia,"Reaction to the plan was mixed.  Attendees at the city's meeting were reported to be highly enthusiastic.[70] But Beth Purcell, president of the Capitol Hill Restoration Society, called the plan ""bizarre"" and argued that the city should not delay construction of the overlooks and fishing piers in favor of an unstudied design proposal with no funding.[65] David Alpert, of the prominent local blog Greater Greater Washington, was more muted in his criticism.  Writing for The Washington Post, he pointed out that the ""recreation bridge"" connected two neighborhoods of only moderate population density, and was not easily accessed from either side of the river. He argued that the space would have to have enough activity and importance to make it a ""destination"" space day and night. He cautioned that the space could easily turn into a dead zone or encourage crime and that the space would have to be connected to the 11th Street Bridges local-only span's bicycle/pedestrian lanes. He also suggested that one or more DC Streetcar stops be created along the bridge.[70]

United States Department of Homeland Security - Wikipedia,"The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the U.S. federal executive department responsible for public security, roughly comparable to the interior or home ministries of other countries. Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, immigration and customs, cyber security, and disaster prevention and management.[3]

United States Department of Homeland Security - Wikipedia,"It began operations in 2003, formed as a result of the Homeland Security Act, enacted the previous year in response to the 9/11 attacks. With more than 240,000 employees,[1] DHS is the third largest Cabinet department, after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.[4] Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.

United States Department of Homeland Security - Wikipedia,"Ridge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001.[6] On November 25, 2002, the Homeland Security Act established the Department of Homeland Security to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to ""homeland security"" into a single Cabinet agency. The Gilmore Commission, supported by much of Congress and John Bolton, helped further solidify need for the department. The DHS incorporated the following 22 agencies:[7]

United States Department of Homeland Security - Wikipedia,"According to border theorist Peter Andreas, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War[8] and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947 (which had placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency). DHS constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization.[9] The founding of the DHS marked a change in American thought towards threats.
Introducing the term ""homeland"" centers attention on a population that needs to be protected not only against emergencies such as natural disasters but also against diffuse threats from individuals who are non-native to the United States.[10]
"
United States Department of Homeland Security - Wikipedia,"Prior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption was focused on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither were included). The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated ""riders"", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives. The plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights.[11] In 2002, Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.[12]

United States Department of Homeland Security - Wikipedia,"In February 2005, DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR. The Washington Post said that the rules would allow DHS ""to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department-wide directive"" and would make it ""difficult, if not impossible, for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing, deployments, technology and other workplace matters"".[12] In August 2005, U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective-bargaining rights for DHS employees.[12] A federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006; pending a final resolution to the litigation, Congress's fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system.[12]
DHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name ""MaxHR"".[5] In a February 2008 court filing, DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules, and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor-management procedures. A federal court issued an order closing the case.[12]

Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism.[17] On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the U.S. Customs Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations, the primary investigative arm of DHS. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

United States Department of Homeland Security - Wikipedia,"In 2011, the Department of Homeland Security phased out the old Homeland Security Advisory System, replacing it with a two-level National Terrorism Advisory System. The system has two types of advisories: alerts and bulletins. NTAS bulletins permit the secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that, while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States, can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly, thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures. Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States. Alerts have two levels: elevated and imminent. An elevated alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target. An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending in the very near term.

Many procedures at government facilities are tied into the alert level; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level. Since January 2003, it has been administered in coordination with DHS; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration's detractors about its ineffectiveness.

The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words ""U.S. DEPARTMENT OF"" in the top half and ""HOMELAND SECURITY"" in the bottom half in a circular placement. The eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows.
Centered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland – air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department.

Data mining - Wikipedia,"Data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.[1] Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.[1][2][3][4] Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD.[5] Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.[1]
"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer, because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.[6] It also is a buzzword[7] and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java[8] (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named just Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons.[9] Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.
"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.
"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data; in contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]

Data mining - Wikipedia,"The related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.
"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"In the 1960s, statisticians and economists used terms like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an a-priori hypothesis. The term ""data mining"" was used in a similarly critical way by economist Michael Lovell in an article published in the Review of Economic Studies in 1983.[11][12] Lovell indicates that the practice ""masquerades under a variety of aliases, ranging from ""experimentation"" (positive) to ""fishing"" or ""snooping"" (negative).

Data mining - Wikipedia,"The term data mining appeared around 1990 in the database community, generally with positive connotations. For a short time in 1980s, a phrase ""database mining""™, was used, but since it was trademarked by HNC, a San Diego-based company, to pitch their Database Mining Workstation;[13] researchers consequently turned to data mining. Other terms used include data archaeology, information harvesting, information discovery, knowledge extraction, etc. Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro coined the term ""knowledge discovery in databases"" for the first workshop on the same topic (KDD-1989) and this term became more popular in AI and machine learning community. However, the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities.[14] Currently, the terms data mining and knowledge discovery are used interchangeably.

A year later, in 1996, Usama Fayyad launched the journal by Kluwer called Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery as its founding editor-in-chief.

Data mining - Wikipedia,"The manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes' theorem (1700s) and regression analysis (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability. As data sets have grown in size and complexity, direct ""hands-on"" data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automated data processing, aided by other discoveries in computer science, specially in the field of machine learning, such as neural networks, cluster analysis, genetic algorithms (1950s), decision trees and decision rules (1960s), and support vector machines (1990s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns.[16] in large data sets. It bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever-larger data sets.

Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models,[18] and Azevedo and Santos conducted a comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA in 2008.[19]
"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"Before data mining algorithms can be used, a target data set must be assembled. As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse. Pre-processing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data.

Data mining - Wikipedia,"Data mining involves six common classes of tasks:[5]
"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"Data mining can unintentionally be misused, and can then produce results that appear to be significant; but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data and bear little use. Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing. A simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting, but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split—when applicable at all—may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening.[20]
"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called overfitting. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish ""spam"" from ""legitimate"" emails would be trained on a training set of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had not been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. Several statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as ROC curves.
"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, subsequently it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge.

"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"Data mining requires data preparation which uncovers information or patterns which compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way for this to occur is through data aggregation. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) in a way that facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent).[30] This is not data mining per se, but a result of the preparation of data before—and for the purposes of—the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.[31][32][33]

"
Data mining - Wikipedia,"In the United States, privacy concerns have been addressed by the US Congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HIPAA requires individuals to give their ""informed consent"" regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses. According to an article in Biotech Business Week, ""'[i]n practice, HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena,' says the AAHC. More importantly, the rule's goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals.""[38] This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices.

Data mining - Wikipedia,"Under European copyright and database laws, the mining of in-copyright works (such as by web mining) without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe, it may be that there is no copyright—but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to intellectual property owners' rights that are protected by the Database Directive. On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review, this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception.[39] The UK was the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the Information Society Directive (2001), the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.

As content mining is transformative, that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one being text and data mining.[42]

Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to identify objects uniquely, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).[1] An implementation of the Handle System,[2][3] DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications. However, they also have been used to identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"A DOI aims to be ""resolvable"", usually to some form of access to the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL, indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to identify their referents uniquely. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL. But every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.[4][5][6] It is the publisher's responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link leaving the DOI useless.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000.[7] Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs.[8] The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF.[9] By late April 2011 more than 50 million DOI names had been assigned by some 4,000 organizations,[10] and by April 2013 this number had grown to 85 million DOI names assigned through 9,500 organizations.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"A DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a character string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is at least a four digit number greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants.[11][12] The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.[13]
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"For example, in the DOI name 10.1000/182, the prefix is 10.1000 and the suffix is 182. The ""10."" part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,[A] and the characters 1000 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. 182 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the DOI Handbook).
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"DOI names can identify creative works (such as texts, images, audio or video items, and software) in both electronic and physical forms, performances, and abstract works[14] such as licenses, parties to a transaction, etc.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The official DOI Handbook explicitly states that DOIs should display on screens and in print in the format doi:10.1000/182.[15]
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"Contrary to the DOI Handbook, CrossRef, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, https://doi.org/10.1000/182) instead of the officially specified format (for example, doi:10.1000/182)[16][17] This URL is persistent (there is a contract that ensures persistence in the DOI.ORG domain), so it is a PURL – providing the location of an HTTP proxy server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item.[8][18]
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The CrossRef recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyperlinked to its appropriate URL – the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.[19]

"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of persistent identification, in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated. It also associates metadata with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the URI specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on open architectures, incorporates trust mechanisms, and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.[23] DOI name-resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.[24] However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.[25]
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The indecs Content Model as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as GS1 and ISBN.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"A DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the Uniform Resource Identifier (Uniform Resource Name) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.[26]
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"A DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.[27]
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"The DOI system offers persistent, semantically-interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as ""identifiers"" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other ""identifier systems"" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"A DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a Uniform Resource Name (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"DOI name resolution is provided through the Handle System, developed by Corporation for National Research Initiatives, and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <type> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"To resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as doi.org.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"Another approach, which avoids typing or cutting-and-pasting into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as https://doi.org/ (preferred)[28] or http://dx.doi.org/, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI 10.1000/182 can be included in a reference or hyperlink as https://doi.org/10.1000/182. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"Other DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a non-paywalled version of a title and redirects the user to that instead of the publisher's version.[29][30] Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016[31] (later Unpaywall). While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).[29][31]
"
Digital object identifier - Wikipedia,"An alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,[32] which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox, enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like hdl:4263537/4000 or doi:10.1000/1 directly in the Firefox browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.

EXPRESS (data modeling language) - Wikipedia,"An entity instance can be constructed for either a single entity (if not abstract) or for a complex combination of entities in such a sub-supertype graph. For the big graphs the number of possible combinations is likely to grow in astronomic ranges. To restrict the possible combinations special supertype constraints got introduced such as ONEOF and TOTALOVER. Furthermore, an entity can be declared to be abstract to enforce that no instance can be constructed of just this entity but only if it contains a non-abstract subtype.

The color space conversion is faster, but the overall decoding (and encoding) is still slower than it needs to be, or some of the competition, even with the better color space as that is only a small fraction of the overall process. The format supports an optional alpha channel (RGBA) like PNG (but unlike JPEG); and progressive coding, similar to PNG (unlike it, progressive compression doesn't increase file-size), but as FLIF's algorithm is more complex (and partly, may not have had as much tuning of the implementation yet), it has a higher computational cost; at least lower bandwidth requirements can offset some of that extra time.

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe (CompuServe Information Service, also known by its initialism CIS) was an American online service provider, the first major commercial one in the United States – described in 1994 as ""the oldest of the Big Three information services (the others are Prodigy and America Online).""[1]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major influence through the mid-1990s. At its peak in the early 1990s, CIS was known for its online chat system, message forums covering a variety of topics, extensive software libraries for most computer platforms, and a series of popular online games, notably MegaWars III and Island of Kesmai. It also was known for its introduction of the GIF format for pictures and as a GIF exchange mechanism.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In 1997, 17 years after H & R Block had acquired CIS, the parent announced its desire to sell the company. A complex deal was worked out with WorldCom acting as a broker, resulting in CIS being sold to AOL. In 2015, Verizon acquired AOL, including its CompuServe division. In 2017, after Verizon completed its acquisition of Yahoo!, CompuServe became part of Verizon's newly formed Oath Inc. subsidiary.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe was founded in 1969 as Compu-Serv Network, Inc.[a] in Columbus, Ohio, as a subsidiary of Golden United Life Insurance. Their focus was on business customers.[2]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Though Golden United founder Harry Gard Sr.'s son-in-law Jeffrey Wilkins is widely miscredited as the first president of CompuServe, its first president was John R. Goltz.[3] Wilkins replaced Goltz as CEO within the first year of operation. Goltz and Wilkins were both graduate students in electrical engineering at the University of Arizona. Other early recruits from the University included Sandy Trevor (inventor of the CompuServe CB Simulator chat system), Doug Chinnock, and Larry Shelley.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"The company's objectives were twofold: to provide in-house computer processing support to Golden United Life Insurance; and to develop as an independent business in the computer time-sharing industry, by renting time on its PDP-10 midrange computers during business hours. It was spun off as a separate company in 1975, trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol CMPU.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Concurrently, the company recruited executives who shifted the focus from offering time-sharing services, in which customers wrote their own applications, to one that was focused on packaged applications. The first of these new executives was Robert Tillson, who left Service Bureau Corporation (then a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation, but originally formed as a division of IBM) to become CompuServe's Executive Vice President of Marketing. He then recruited Charles McCall (who followed Jeff Wilkins as CEO, and later became CEO of medical information firm HBO & Co.), Maury Cox (who became CEO[4] after the departure of McCall), and Robert Massey (who followed Cox as CEO).
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In 1977, CompuServe's board changed the company's name to CompuServe Incorporated. In 1979, it began ""offering a dial-up online information service to consumers.""[2] In 1980, H&R Block acquired CompuServe.[5]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"The original 1969 dial-up technology was fairly simple—the local phone number in Cleveland, for example, was a line connected to a time-division multiplexer that connected via a  leased line to a matched multiplexer in Columbus that was connected to a time-sharing host system. In the earliest buildups, each line terminated on a single machine at CompuServe's host, so different numbers had to be used to reach different computers.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Later, the central multiplexers in Columbus were replaced with PDP-8 minicomputers, and the PDP-8s were connected to a DEC PDP-15 minicomputer that acted as switches so a phone number was not tied to a particular destination host. Finally, CompuServe developed its own packet switching network, implemented on DEC PDP-11 minicomputers acting as network nodes that were installed throughout the US (and later, in other countries) and interconnected. Over time, the CompuServe network evolved into a complicated multi-tiered network incorporating asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), frame relay (FR), Internet Protocol (IP) and X.25 technologies.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In 1981, The Times explained CompuServe's technology in one sentence:
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,CompuServe is offering a video-text-like service permitting personal computer users to retrieve software from the mainframe computer over telephone lines.[6]
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"The New York Times described them as ""the most international of the Big Three"" and noted that ""it can be reached by a local phone call in more than 700 cities"".[1]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe was also a world leader in other commercial services. One of these was the Financial Services group, which collected and consolidated financial data from myriad data feeds, including CompuStat, Disclosure, I/B/E/S as well as the price/quote feeds from the major exchanges. CompuServe developed extensive screening and reporting tools that were used by many investment banks on Wall Street.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In 1979,[2] Radio Shack marketed the residential information service MicroNET, in which home users accessed the computers during evening hours, when the CompuServe computers were otherwise idle. Its success prompted CompuServe to drop the MicroNET name in favor of its own. CompuServe's origin was approximately concurrent with that of The Source.[b][2]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Both services were operating in early 1979, being the first online services. MicroNet was made popular through the Issue 2 of Commodore Disk User, which included instructions on how to connect and run MicroNet programs.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"By the mid-1980s, CompuServe was one of the largest information and networking services companies, and it was the largest consumer information service. It operated commercial branches in more than 30 US cities, selling primarily network services to major corporations throughout the United States. Consumer accounts could be bought in most computer stores (a box with an instruction manual and a trial account login) and awareness of this service was extremely high. By 1987, the consumer side would be 50% of CompuServe revenues.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"The corporate culture was entrepreneurial, encouraging ""skunkworks projects"". Alexander ""Sandy"" Trevor secluded himself for a weekend, writing the ""CB Simulator"", a chat system that soon became one of CIS's most popular features.[2] Instead of hiring employees to manage the forums, they contracted with sysops, who received compensation based on the success of their own forum's boards, libraries, and chat areas.[7]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In July 1980, working with Associated Press, CompuServe began hosting text versions of the Columbus Dispatch. The New York Times, Virginian-Pilot and Ledger Star, The Washington Post, San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco Chronicle, and Los Angeles Times were added in 1981; additional newspapers followed.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Although accessing articles in these newspapers made up 5% of CompuServe's traffic, reading an entire newspaper using this method was impractical; the text of a $0.20 print edition newspaper would take two to six hours to download at a cost of $5 per hour (after 6 p.m.).[8]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Another major unit of CompuServe, the CompuServe Network Services, was formed in 1982 to generate revenue by selling connectivity on the nationwide packet network CompuServe had built to support its time-sharing service. CompuServe designed and manufactured its own network processors, based on the DEC PDP-11, and wrote all the software that ran in the network. Often (and erroneously) called an X.25 network, the CompuServe network implemented a mixture of standardized and proprietary layers throughout the network.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"One of the proprietary layers was called Adaptive Routing.[9] The Adaptive Routing system implemented two powerful features. One is that the network operated entirely in a self-discovery mode. When a new switch was added to the network by connecting it to a neighbor via a leased telephone circuit, the new switch was discovered and absorbed into the network without explicit configuration. To change the network configuration, all that was needed was to add or remove connections, and the network would automatically reconfigure. The second feature implemented by Adaptive Routing was often talked about in network engineering circles, but was implemented only by CNS - establishing connection paths on the basis of real-time performance measurements. As one circuit became busy, traffic was diverted to alternative paths to prevent overloading and poor performance for users.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"While the CNS network was not itself based on the X.25 protocol, the network presented a standard X.25 interface to the outside world, providing dialup connectivity to corporate hosts, and allowing CompuServe to form alliances with private networks Tymnet and Telenet, among others.[10] This gave CompuServe the largest selection of local dial-up phone connections in the world, in an era when network usage charges were expensive, but still lower than long-distance charges. Other networks permitted CompuServe access to still more locations, including international locations, usually with substantial connect-time surcharges. It was common in the early 1980s to pay a $30-per-hour charge to connect to CompuServe, which at the time cost $5 to $6 per hour before factoring in the connect-time surcharges. This resulted in the company being nicknamed CompuSpend, Compu$erve or CI$.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CNS has been the primary supplier of dial-up communications for credit-card authorizations for more than 20 years, a competence developed through its long relationship with Visa International. At the peak of this line of business, CompuServe carried millions of authorization transactions each month, representing several billion dollars of consumer purchase transactions. For many businesses an always-on connection was an extravagance, and a dialup option made better sense. Today this service remains in operation, deeply embedded within Verizon (see below). There are no other competitors remaining in this market.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"The company was notable for introducing a number of online services to personal computer users. CompuServe began offering electronic mail capabilities and technical support to commercial customers in 1978 under the name Infoplex, and was also a pioneer in the real-time chat market with its CB Simulator service introduced on February 21, 1980 as the first public, commercial multi-user chat program. Introduced in 1985, EaasySABRE, a customer-accessible extension of the Sabre travel system, made it possible for individuals to find and book airline flights and hotel rooms without the help of a travel agent.[11] CompuServe also introduced a number of online games.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Around 1981, CompuServe introduced its CompuServe B protocol, a file-transfer protocol, allowing users to send files to each other. This was later expanded to the higher-performance B+ version, intended for downloads from CIS itself. Although the B+ protocol was not widely supported by other software, it was used by default for some time on CIS itself. The B+ protocol was later extended to include the Host-Micro Interface (HMI), a mechanism for communicating commands and transaction requests to a server application running on the mainframes. HMI could be used by ""front end"" client software to present a GUI-based interface to CIS, without having to use the error-prone CLI to route commands.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe began to expand its reach outside the United States. It entered the international arena in Japan in 1986 with Fujitsu and Nissho Iwai, and developed a Japanese-language version of CompuServe called NIFTY-Serve in 1989. In 1993, CompuServe Hong Kong was launched in a joint venture with Hutchison Telecom and was able to acquire 50,000 customers before the dialup ISP frenzy. Between 1994 and 1995 Fujitsu and CompuServe co-developed WorldsAway, an interactive virtual world. As of 2014 the original world that launched on CompuServe in 1995, known as the Dreamscape, is still operating.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In the late 1980s, it was possible to log on to CompuServe via worldwide X.25 packet switching networks, which bridged onto CompuServe's existing US-based network. Gradually it introduced its own direct dial-up access network in many countries, a more economical solution. With its network expansion, CompuServe also extended the marketing of its commercial services, opening branches in London and Munich.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe was the first online service to offer Internet connectivity, albeit with limited access, as early as 1989[12] when it connected its proprietary e-mail service to allow incoming and outgoing messages to be exchanged with Internet-based e-mail addresses.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In the early 1990s, CompuServe had hundreds of thousands of users visiting its thousands of moderated forums, forerunners to the discussion sites on the Web.  (Like the Web, many forums were managed by independent producers who then administered the forum and recruited moderators, called sysops.) Among these were many in which hardware and software companies offered customer support. This broadened the audience from primarily business users to the technical ""geek"" crowd, some of whom migrated over from Byte Magazine's Bix online service.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"There were special forums, special groups, but many had ""relatively large premiums"" (as did ""some premium data bases"" with charges of ""$7.50 each time you enter a search request.""[c][1]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In 1992, CompuServe hosted the first known WYSIWYG e-mail content and forum posts.[13] Fonts, colors and emoticons were encoded into 7-bit text-based messages via the third party product NavCIS (Dvorak Development) running on DOS and Windows 3.1, and later, Windows 95[14] operating systems.  NavCIS included features for offline work, similar to offline readers used with Bulletin board systems, allowing users to connect to the service and exchange new mail and forum content in a largely automated fashion. Once the ""run"" was complete, the user edited their messages locally in offline mode. The system also allowed interactive navigation of the system to support services like the chat system. Many of these services remained text based.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe later introduced CompuServe Information Manager (CIM) to compete more directly with AOL. Unlike Navigator, CIM was tuned for online work, and used a point-and-click interface very similar to AOLs. Later versions interacted with the hosts using the  HMI communications protocol. For some areas of the service which did not support HMI, the older text-based interface could be used. WinCIM also allowed caching of forum messages, news articles and e-mail, so that reading and posting could be performed off-line, without incurring hourly connect costs. Previously, this was a luxury of the NavCIS, AutoSIG and TapCIS applications for power users.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"One of the big advantages of CIS over the Internet was that the users could purchase services and software from other CompuServe members using their CompuServe account. At this time, the internet backbone was operated by NSFnet, and use of internet accounts for commercial activity was prohibited.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"During the early 1990s the hourly rate fell from over $10 an hour to $1.95 an hour. In March 1992, it launched online signups with credit card based payments and a desktop application to connect online and check emails. In April 1995, CompuServe topped three million members, still the largest online service provider, and launched its NetLauncher service, providing WWW access capability via the Spry Mosaic browser. AOL, however, introduced a far cheaper flat-rate, unlimited-time, advertisement-supported price plan in the US to compete with CompuServe's hourly charges. In conjunction with AOL's marketing campaigns, this caused a significant loss of customers until CompuServe responded with a similar plan of its own at $24.95 per month in late 1997.[15][16]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"As the World Wide Web grew in popularity with the general public, company after company closed their once-busy CompuServe customer support forums to offer customer support to a larger audience directly through company websites, an area which the CompuServe forums of the time could not address because they had not yet introduced universal WWW access.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In 1992, CompuServe acquired Mark Cuban's company, MicroSolutions, for $6 million.[17][18]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"AOL's entry into the PC market in 1991 marked the beginning of the end for CIS. AOL charged $2.95 an hour versus $5.00 an hour for CompuServe. AOL used a freely available GUI-based client; CompuServe's wasn't free, and it only supported a subset of the system's functionality. In response, CIS lowered its hourly rates on several occasions. Subsequently, AOL switched to a monthly subscription instead of hourly rates, so for active users AOL was much less expensive. By late 1994, CompuServe was offering ""unlimited use of the standard services (including news, sports, weather ... and limited electronic mail""[d] for $8.95 per month - what The New York Times called ""probably the best deal.""[1]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CIS' number of users grew, peaking in April 1995 at 3 million worldwide. By this point AOL had over 20 million users in the United States alone, but this was off their peak of 27 million, due to customers leaving for lower-cost offerings. By 1997 the number of users leaving all online services for dialup Internet service providers was reaching a climax.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In 1997, CompuServe began converting its  forums from its proprietary Host-Micro Interface (HMI) to HTML web standards.[19] The 1997 change discontinued text based access to the forums, but the forums were accessible both through the web as well as through CompuServe's proprietary HMI protocol. In 2004 CompuServe discontinued HMI and converted the forums to web access only. The forums remained active on CompuServe.com until the end of 2017.

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"The service was proposed by Paul Stanfield, an independent business-to-consumer electronic commerce consultant, to Martin Turner, Product Marketing Director for CIS UK, in August 1994. Turner agreed and the project started in September with rapid market research, product development and sales of online space to major UK retail and catalogue companies. These included WH Smith, Tesco, Virgin/Our Price, Great Universal Stores/GUS, Interflora, Dixons Retail, Past Times, PC World (retailer) and Innovations.[27][28]

Indeed, in 1985 it hosted perhaps the first online comic in the world, Witches and Stitches. CompuServe introduced a simple black-and-white image format known as RLE (run-length-encoding) to standardize the images so they could be shared among different microcomputer platforms. With the introduction of more powerful machines, universally supporting color, CompuServe introduced the much more capable GIF format, invented by Steve Wilhite. GIF went on to become the de facto standard for 8-bit images on the Internet in the early and mid-1990s.

The primary argument was that data networking was a brand new industry, and the country would be better served by not exposing this important new industry to the aberrations of the voice telephone economics (the CCAC is the mechanism used to subsidize the cost of local telephone service from long-distance revenue). The FCC agreed with CompuServe's position, and the consequence is that all dial-up networking in the United States, whether on private networks or the public Internet, is much less expensive than it otherwise would have been.

Recent U.S. versions of the CompuServe client software — essentially an enhanced Web browser — used the Gecko layout engine (developed for Mozilla) within a derivative of the AOL client and using the AOL dialup network. The previous CompuServe service offering, re-branded as ""CompuServe Classic"", remained available in the US and also in other countries where CompuServe 2000 was not offered, such as the UK. In Germany, CompuServe 2000 was introduced in 1999 and withdrawn in 2001 because of failure on the German market, but CompuServe Classic service remained for a while. CompuServe Germany introduced its own products for dialup and DSL internet access, and its own client software (called CompuServe 4.5 light).

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"In January 2007, CompuServe e-mailed members that Windows Vista was not supported, and suggested switching to the AOL-branded service. Like many older programs, however, CompuServe client software can run under Windows Vista in compatibility mode. In July 2007, CompuServe Pacific announced[52] cessation as of August 31, 2007. In September 2007, it was announced[53] that CompuServe France would close down its operations on November 30, 2007. In the Pacific region (Australia, New Zealand, etc.) Fujitsu Australia ran the CompuServe Pacific franchise, which in 1998 had 35,000 customers. Towards the end of its operations in that area, it was thought[citation needed] to have far fewer because of CompuServe Pacific's pricing plans, which have not been changed since 1998 (e.g., A$14.95 for 2 hours per month). In July 2008, CompuServe Germany informed its customers that it would close down its operations on July 31, 2008. Its legacy service ""CompuServe Classic"" would not be affected by this decision.

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe forums as of 2013[update] are more tightly linked to CompuServe channels. Compuserve.com currently runs a slightly trimmed-down version of the now-defunct Netscape.com Web portal, the latter of which was shut down in 2006.

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe announced on April 15, 2009 that CompuServe Classic would ""no longer operate as an Internet Service Provider"" and would close on June 30, 2009.[54] All CompuServe Classic services, including OurWorld Web pages, were taken offline as of that date. CompuServe Classic e-mail users would be able to continue using their CompuServe e-mail addresses via a new e-mail system.[55][56]

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"AOL used the CompuServe brand for CompuServe 2000 (a rebranded low-cost offering), which closed in 2011 (including Mac), and CompuServe Dialer (a low-cost dialup ISP that became a Web portal).

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"CompuServe announced in November 2017 that the CompuServe Forums would be shut down on December 15, 2017.[57][58][59] It was over 36 years since the CompuServe Forums had begun in 1981. Some moved to Forumania[60] or elsewhere.

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Over time, there were several graphical user interfaces written for accessing CompuServe.[1] Unlike what AOL gave for free, The New York Times wrote about them ""which Compuserve ought to give away, but does not."" Among their names were WinCIM, TapCIS and NavCIS.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"At a time when subscribers paid for timed access (as well as long-distance calls in some countries) and had to spend time online reading and replying to messages, their goal was to bypass CompuServe's WinCim interface, and streamline[61] sending all pre-written email and forum postings that the user had written offline, then receiving new messages, downloading requested files, and logging off CompuServe.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"TapCIS (The Access Program for the Compuserve Information Service)[e][62] was an automated MS-DOS-based software application that sped up access to, and management of, CompuServe email accounts and forum memberships for PC users from 1981 until 2004 when advances in CompuServe technology rendered it obsolete. It was described as ""archaic-looking (but) .. remains a powerful tool for accessing CompuServe forums.""[63]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"TapCIS was written in Borland's Turbo Pascal by Howard Banner, a marketing executive from Wilmington, Delaware[64] who joined CompuServe in 1981 and died of melanoma in June 1990, aged 44. The software, which was shareware and retailed at US$79, had a community of users who continued to maintain their own website.
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Since it was able to issue administrative commands, TapCIS was the preferred tool for dozens of CompuServe system operators (SysOps).[65]
"
CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Regarding WinCIM (and predecessor CIM), PC Magazine wrote[63] that ""They give you a broader view of what's available"" and by using it ""you can more easily navigate the service."" They explicitly caution that, unlike TapCIS, it  ""won't save any money ... it could actually take you longer to retrieve and answer messages ... than without it.""[63]

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Although OzCIS and OzWIN (its Windows-based successor) were described as ""free for personal use""[63] by PC Magazine, it was shareware,[f][66] like WinCIM, TapCIS and NavCIS.

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Like TapCIS, it had SysOp features such as moving and deleting messages, administering the file libraries, and ""flagging"" users (giving/denying SysOp rights). Unlike other offline readers such as TapCIS and NavCIS, which added proprietary ways of formatting text (colors, fonts, attributes), OzWin always remained ""plain text"" and never displayed any custom styles.

CompuServe - Wikipedia,"Visual CompuServe, also known as VisCIS, was a demo concept of a VRML-based client by programmer John D. Gwinner which modelled the CompuServe interface into a 3D virtual environment.[68][69] It was later redeveloped by Gwinner into VisMenu, a general-purpose VRML menuing system.[70]
